# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 3

Claude decides to attempt to revive Badger. He casts lesser restoration on him which temporarily removes the poisoned condition and wakes him up. The effects of this spell will last one hour.

There are three other doors leading from strangely shaped room. You entered through the door in the west wall. There are also doors to the southwest, north, and northeast. You decide to take the northeast doors. Remy checks for traps, but finds none. The doors open into a passage than snakes northeast, then south, southwest and south and ends with a single door in the east wall. Remy checks for traps again and again finds nothing.

Beyond this door is a large square room. In the center of this room is a withered tree that looks like a leafless willow, rooted in a terraced depression. The bottom of this hollow is filled with oily water, a few inches deep. Across the room, beyond the dead tree, is another door. Around the sides of the room, a five-foot-wide ledge encircles the tree. The walls of the room are beaded with condensation.
