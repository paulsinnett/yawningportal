# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 3

Claude decides to attempt to revive Badger. He casts lesser restoration on him which temporarily removes the poisoned condition and wakes him up. The restoration will only remove the effects for one hour.

There are three other doors leading from strangely shaped room. You entered through the door in the west wall. There are also doors to the southwest, north, and northeast. You decide to take the northeast doors. Remy checks for traps, but finds none. The doors open into a passage than snakes northeast, then south, southwest and south and ends with a single door in the east wall. Remy checks for traps again, and again finds nothing.

Poon Tang throws more alchemist's fire over the trunk. Still grappled, Claude hits the tree with a guiding bolt and throws Badger the obsidian-toothed sword. Badger attacks with the magic sword; it's obsidian teeth slice through the tree creature's thick skin. Badger cuts his way through the creature and out the other side.

With the creature defeated, you rest a while to patch your wounds and extinguish any fires. Claude takes some time to identify some of the magic items you have collected.
