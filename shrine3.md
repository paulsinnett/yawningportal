# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 3

Claude decides to attempt to revive Badger. He casts _lesser restoration_ on him which temporarily removes the poisoned condition and wakes him up. Although the restoration will only remove the effects for one hour. Claude believes he can use the silvery dust in the crystal flask to craft a permanent antidote. But it will take him a while to and some resources to do it. In the meantime, you will have to revive him when you need him by temporarily removing his poisoned condition. You bring Badger up to date with your adventures and his condition.

You find nothing more in the strangely shaped room. Badger takes the jade cat statue from the altar. There are three other doors leading from the room. You entered through the door in the west wall. There are also doors to the southwest, north, and northeast. You decide to take the northeast doors. Remy checks for traps, but finds none. The doors open into a passage than snakes northeast, then south, southwest and south and ends with a single door in the east wall. Remy checks for traps again, and again finds nothing.

Beyond this door is a large square room. In the center of this room is a withered tree that looks like a leafless willow, rooted in a terraced depression. The bottom of this hollow is filled with oily water, a few inches deep. Across the room, beyond the dead tree, is another door. Around the sides of the room, a five-foot-wide ledge encircles the tree. The walls of the room are beaded with condensation.

You approach the tree cautiously. Suddenly it begins to move. Long tentacles lash out to ensnare you and draw you in to a mouth surrounded by sharp spines. Remy attacks, but he is unable to get through the tree's hard bark. Badger flies into a rage and attacks with his scimitar. Badger, Dioica, and Ocardo are all grabbed by tentacles. The tree reels in Badger and tries to eat him. Ocardo manages to get free. Dioica casts an _erupting earth_ spell, creating a fountain of churned earth and stone, and damaging the tree significantly.

Claude casts a _guiding bolt_ at the tree but misses. The tree grabs Claude as well. Ocardo chops through a tendril to free Badger, while Dioica uses some _alchemist's fire_ to try to burn herself free. Poon Tang throws more _alchemist's fire_ over the trunk. Still grappled, Claude hits the tree with a _guiding bolt_ and throws Badger the _obsidian-toothed sword_. Badger attacks with the magic sword; it's obsidian teeth slice through the tree creature's thick skin. Badger cuts his way through the creature and out the other side.

With the creature defeated, you rest a while to patch your wounds and extinguish any fires. Claude takes some time to identify some of the magic items you have collected. The bracers are _bracers of defence_. The jade ring in the form of a man holding the moon is a _ring of fire resistance_. The jade ring in the form of a panther ready to strike is a _ring of animal influence_. The 'bracelet' is a _giant's ring of rock magic_. Poon Tang attunes to it. It grants her immunity to petrification, and allows 3 castings of _flesh to stone_. When the 3 castings are used up, it then allows 13 castings of _stone shape_. After these castings are used up, it loses its magic and turns from gold to lead. The dagger is a _+1 dagger_. And the battleaxe is a _+2 magic battleaxe_. Badger attunes to it. It increases his hit point maximum by his level. It also has three spells wrapped into its handle: _passwall_, _burning hands_, and _gust of wind_. It has 12 charges and regains 1d6+4 charges daily at dawn. Casting takes charges equal to the level of the spell.

After your short rest, you check for traps and continue through the east door. It opens into a passage leading south. You follow until it opens into an enormous chamber, thirty feet tall, with mighty buttressing and a vaulted ceiling. Parts of the ceiling and walls have collapsed, and raw earth has spilled down from a gaping hole in the east wall. Crushed beneath a fallen block in the center of the room are humanoid remains. Elsewhere around the floor are the chewed and decayed corpses of baboons. Through a hole in the eastern ceiling, daylight and fresh air filter in. Above, through this gap, can be seen four baboons. They jump around the hole and and scream in agitation, and as they do, dirt begins to slide down the banks and rocks in the walls shift slightly.

You cautiously cross the chamber. The exit on the other side is a set of double bronze doors in the north wall. Above them is a plaque inlaid with jade depicting a two-headed serpent, with the second head where its tail should be. As you check this door for traps, a giant two headed snake tries to sneak up on you through the rubble.

Poon Tang uses her magic bracelet to attempt to turn the creature to stone. Unfortunately, the magic fails on this creature. Dioica stabs at it with her spear. Claude attacks with his magic rapier, but misses. Ocardo hits it with an _eldritch blast_. And badger hits it with his scimitar although he finds his mind drawn to his axe and can't properly concentrate on his attacks. Remy also misses his attack and it looks like the snake is going to get him but he uses his _second chance_ to avoid the attack. The other head attacks Claude, but misses as well.

Poon Tang tries again with the magic bracelet, but is unable to effect the creature. Dioica transforms herself into a bear and battles one head while Claude skewers the other with his rapier. However, with the giant two headed snake defeated, the baboons now climb down into the chamber and start throwing rocks at you. Dioica casts _animal friendship_ to calm the baboons.

You investigate the fallen blocks in the center of the room. Badger uses his _aspect of the bear_ to gain extra strength and heave the block off of the crushed humanoid remains. You find a pouch containing 40 electrum pieces, a broach of bronze and green quartz in the shape of a lizard, aa silver and beryl-emerald ring, a silvery dagger, and a scroll case. The scroll case contains a map of the territory that the ruins are located within. A search of the area also turns up a cracked 3 inch crystal sphere.

Using a combination of Ocardo's _misty step_, Remy's magic whistle, Dioica's shape changing and help from the baboons you manage to climb out through the hole in the roof of the chamber and make a camp on the outside. You take a long rest to heal and identify your further finds. The powder in the glazed clay container stopped with flower-shaped plugs is the dried out remains of a potion of invisibility. The red liquid in the bottle you found at the feet of the corpse in the first tomb is an _elixir of health_. The pendants made of silver and turquoise are each an _amulet of protection from turning_. Ocardo contacts Terry and he advises him to check the body of the tree creature. You also notice that Bobolink is missing.

After you have rested and reawakened Badger, you go back into the temple ruins to examine the tree creature's corpse. Cutting into it, you find 12 pieces of blue jasper and a silvery rod. Claude identifies the rod as a _wand of lightning bolts_.

You return to the cave-in chamber and try the west door. It leads into a room the floor of which is covered with a layer of fine gray dust and ash, three inches deep. Across the room, opposite where you entered, is another set of double doors. There are two empty alcoves to the north and south. On small ledges in each corner of the room are pieces of what appear to be broken pottery.

Remy flies across the room and as he does so, sends motes of dust and ash swirling into the air, and these clouds form into shapes.

First, from the ash, a dusty phantom assumes the shape of a woman. Her face is forlorn and tear-streaked. She throws up her hands in despair, rushes into one of the alcoves, and disappears.

Immediately afterwards, two more dusty phantoms emerge — mighty warriors armed with jagged-edged swords and bearing fierce countenances. They move to block the doorway opposite where you entered.

You attempt to attack the phantoms and they collapse at the merest touch. They act in a threatening manner but they are unable to harm you. After searching for secrets and loot you continue on and find yourself back in the cat room, this time through the south west door. However, there is something different about it... the cat-man statue has gone.

As you carefully search the room, Poon Tang is suddenly attacked by a jaguar. Remy manages to hit the creature and Dioica uses the almost all of the charges in the _wand of lightning bolts_. However it still takes additional hits from Remy and an _eldritch blast_ from Ocardo to stop it. The last hit from Ocardo turns the creature to stone.

Searching the room again, you find a secret door concealed in the mouth of the wall carving. The catch to open it is in the hollow of the right eye. Beyond, is a passage, the walls of which glow magenta, bathing the corridor with a ghastly hue. After fifteen feet, the floor drops away to a pit that fills the hallway ahead. The pit is twenty-five feet deep. Eight large, spidery bushes with thorny stems, white leaves, and enormous yellow blossoms grow across its bottom.

Five feet beyond the nearest edge of the pit is a bronze bar, set level with the floor and embedded in the pit walls to either side. Farther out over the pit can be seen other similar bronze rungs, set at five-foot intervals. On the floor by the edge of the pit is a scattering of broken, rotting wooden planks.

The bushes in the pit sling thorns at anyone looking over. Badger sets fire to the bushes and then searches the area once the danger is gone. Unfortunately, you find nothing here for your trouble.

You take the final door from the cat room to the north. A passage leads toward a set of double bronze doors bearing the engraved face of the jaguar god. Both walls of the corridor are carved to represent two lines of warriors in profile, holding hatchet-headed pole-arms and facing the western doors. These figures are painted with vivid, lifelike colors: red, black, white, green, and yellow. Remy doesn't see any traps here, so Ocardo moves towards the door. But unfortunately there is a pressure plate at the mid-point of this corridor. Two carved warriors pivot out from the walls in front of you, crossing their metal halberds to bar your way. The blades spark and hum as they are brought together. Ocardo attempts to crawl under but he touches a blade and is electrocuted. Thinking quickly, Remy uses his _mage hand_ to move Ocardo out of contact with the blades. He then disarms the trap while Badger crawls under.

When the door comes open, a rush of warm, foetid air greets you. The room is lit with a sanguine glow. On the wall opposite the door are tacked several human skins. A cat-o’-nine-tails hangs beside them.

To the west the room widens to accommodate a statue that towers almost to the ceiling. The statue is an ogre-like figure, outfitted in flayed skins and adorned with skulls, with a gaping mouth wide enough to swallow a horse whole. It is seated atop a huge basin of red-hot coals, more than ten feet in diameter.

Around the statue is a pile of splintered bones, skulls with cracked pates, and broken weapons. In front of the display crouches a panther, deathly still, facing away from the statue.

To the east the walls are highly polished. They loosely enclose an intricately carved well that seems to be illuminated from within. Beyond the well, mounted on the wall, is a blackened mirror with a richly ornamented frame. Directly above the well, in the twenty-five-foot-high ceiling, a five-foot-wide opening can be discerned in the red light of the room.

As you approach the statue, the panther stands and pads menacingly in your direction but then continues past appearing not to notice you. "It's that prick Bobolink!" says Remy. Claude detects that the mirror is not magical while Badger begins a ritual to allow him to talk with the panther and Ocardo searches around the statue. Ocardo find a broken mace. The head is good but it will need a new handle to be useful. Dioica climbs down into the well to find the source of the light. As soon as she does, a brilliant light flashes upward and a bellowing voice fills the chamber. The voice is speaking in the giant language.

Dioica climbs out of the well. She has some oily light on her hand. The light is slowly spreading over her body. She isn't able to wipe it off. Claude casts _tongues_ on Dioica. She understands it to be saying "Who disturbs Xipe and for what purpose?" Dioica says they bring gifts. She shape changes into and snake and then sheds her skin before returning to her normal form. The oily light remains on the shed skin.

Remy uses the magic whistle to fly up above the well into the chamber above carrying a rope. Ocardo uses a _misty step_ to get up there. Dioica climbs up. Beyond the hole in the ceiling is a chamber that measures 30 feet in each direction. There is a giant blue creature in the chamber. He casts _fear_ at the group with a bellow that shakes the room.

![a picture of a blue skinned giant](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/297/278/315/636252771507213738.jpeg "Xipe")

Dioica is effected by the fear and makes a run for it. Poon Tang climbs up. She attempts to use the rock magic ring for the final time. It doesn't work and the ring can now cast _stone shape_ up to 13 times. Remy and Ocardo both attack Xipe and Xipe attacks Ocardo and then casts _sleep_ on the party but it fails. Meanwhile, Dioica shakes off the fear spell and climbs back up the rope. She uses the last charge on the _wand of lightning bolts_ to hit Xipe and kill him. Ocardo drains his life force as he dies.
