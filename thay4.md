# Dead in Thay: Part 4

Poon Tang escorts the dragon turtle back through a black gate to the gatehouse. After freeing the dragon turtle, you decide to disrupt the black gate to prevent others from teleporting in behind you. Ocardo attempts to disrupt it but is forced back. Bobolink succeeds.

Chas casts _light_ on Badger's belt buckle and you move on through the door in the south of the Naga's chamber. There is a short, dark, trapped passage, leading south, and blocked by a white gate. You avoid the traps and use one of your glyph keys to open the white gate. Beyond is a circular chamber. A circular pool in this chamber has foul slime filled with bits of bone along its edge. To the west is a black gate.

Ocardo detects a couple of creatures at the bottom of the pool. Badger readies his attack. _Wave_ attempts to communicate with the creatures, but they emerge from their pool and attack. They are aquatic trolls, otherwise known as scrags.

![aquatic troll](https://vignette.wikia.nocookie.net/forgottenrealms/images/7/74/SCRAG.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/406?cb=20170720212603 "Scrag")

Badger attacks and Bobolink casts a _lightning bolt_ hitting both. Chas attempts to hit them with a _sacred flame_ and Claude casts _toll the dead_ but neither has any effect. Remy makes a sneak attack with his bow while Ocardo attacks with _Blackrazor_. Badger manages to kill one of the trolls. Dave approaches to attack, but slips on the crusted remains of the scrags' meals and falls into the pool. The remaining creature attempts to eat Dave.

Bobolink, Chas, and Remy attempt to rescue Dave by attacking the troll, but they all miss. Ocardo finishes the troll using _Blackrazor_ to devour its soul.

You search the room, but you find nothing of value among the remains of the trolls' meals or at the bottom of the pool. You then go through the door to the southeast. It opens into a much larger circular room. The stench of death is overwhelming here. The pool at the center of this chamber is a blackened sea of floating corpses. Three enormous globes of blue liquid are suspended in the air to the east.

West of the pool, just south of a set of double doors, is a contact stone.

Badger readies an attack. Ocardo enters the room. He detects no living creatures in the room so he investigates the globes. He finds that he can control them by moving them around. He can also enter the globe and swim around inside. Bobolink uses his _mage hand_ to search the bodies in the water. He finds nothing valuable but he wakens the creatures, which are aquatic ghouls, otherwise known as lacedons. They attack.

Badger is ready with his weapons and attacks a nearby ghoul. Remy holds his attack until the ghouls reach him. Ocardo casts _cone of cold_ and turns 7 of the 8 into frozen statues. Bobolink hits the remaining one with a _magic missile_ and Remy skewers it on his rapier.

You take the southwest door. This leads into another circular chamber. The floor of this sweltering chamber and its pool are spread with a fine layer of shattered bone. The faint illumination from a pair of low-burning braziers reveals piles of animal skulls set around the edge of the water.

In the pool, four merrow are entertaining themselves by decorating their lair and chewing bones. Ocardo curses the creatures and hits them with an _eldritch blast_. Badger fires two arrows (and Al reduces his arrow count by 2 on his character sheet!)

![merman](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/203/231/315/636252764097970952.jpeg "Merrow")

One of the merrow, harpoons Ocardo, pulls him into the filthy pool, and the group begins to feed. Remy fires an arrow at the merrow, and misses, but Chas throws _Whelm_ and hits. Bobolink casts _major image_ to create an illusion of a young dragon turtle approaching the pool.

Ocardo casts _Thunder Step_ and teleports out of the pool hitting the merrow with a thunderous boom that shakes the rooms and echoes throughout the dungeon. Badger hits one of the merrow with an arrow.

One of the merrow attacks the dragon turtle and discovers that it is an illusion. Another harpoons Bobolink and pulls him into the pool. Dave dives into the pool and attacks the merrow with _Wave_. Chas hits another with _Whelm_. Badger takes out the final merrow with an arrow.

Searching their lair you find:

- a pair of engraved bone dice
- a spell scroll

The spell scroll contains a _magic missile_ spell. You then use a black gate to return to the gatehouse and take a long rest. When you return, you take the south passage. The corridor is blocked with a white gate. You use one of your glyph keys to open it and enter the chamber beyond.

Beneath walls set with relief carvings of humanoid couples romantically entwined, the bottom of a slimy, dimly luminous pool is shrouded in shadow. Trenches from the pool flow into one-foot-diameter tubes in the wall. An enormous globe of blue liquid is suspended in the air to the west. Five kuo-toa guard this area and Ocardo detects another four asleep on the bottom of the pool. Ocardo greets them and attempts to intimidate them. They grow angry.

Badger attacks one with his blades, Remy kills one and Ocardo kills another. The remaining kuo-toa attack but their attacks are mostly ineffective. Nine bashes one of the guards and Bobolink casts the _Snilloc's Snowball Swarm_ spell on the guards. The rest of you make short work of dispatching the remaining creatures and move on through the doors to the south. These doors open into a long rectangular hall that opens into a cave to the south.

Relief carvings along this arch-roofed hall show scenes of demons and humanoids engaged in debauchery. Five pits cut into the floor are filled with glowing water. South of these pools on a rough wall is a contact stone. The area is guarded by a dread warrior, two wights, and four zombies. As you enter, the guards see that you are not escorted by kuo-toa and immediately attack.

Badger uses his _wand of magic missiles_ to fire almost all of its charges at the dread warrior. Remy also fires an arrow at the dread warrior but he misses. Ocardo hits one of the wights with an _eldritch blast_. The wights fire arrows, while the zombies move in to attack. Their attacks are not effective.

Claude turns all of the zombies to dust and forces the dread warrior to flee. Chas then casts a _guiding bolt_ at one of the wights. Bobolink casts a _fireball_ and then Badger charges in. Remy and Ocardo both miss with their attacks and one of the wights uses its life drain on Badger. Claude destroys one of the wights with a _sacred flame_ and Chas hits the other with the same. Bobolink takes it out with a _magic missile_.

You destroy the turned dread warrior and find that it has:

- a glyph key attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone.

The cave at the southern end of the hall leads eastwards and ends at double doors. Claude checks the doors and opens them into the next room. Two large pools fill a chamber whose walls are carved with reliefs of humanoids frolicking with cherubic angels. Water from the pools flows into pits that spread along the walls from one corner. A foul pile of debris and bones stands in the opposite corner of the chamber.

There are two merrow in the south pool. A sea hag luxuriates under the surface of the north pool with her pets, six giant crabs. Remy attempts to use his beguiling charm, but neither he nor Dave are able to hold the hag's gaze due to her horrific appearance. However, _Blackrazor_ protects Ocardo and he is able to negotiate for you. The hag calls herself Tanjus and she offers safe passage through her domain and two pieces of lore in return for the destruction of the Naga known as Ihanvas.

![sea hag](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/159/240/315/636252759356069260.jpeg "Tanjus")

After a short discussion among yourselves, you decide to take the bargain. You tell Tanjus that you will bring her the Naga's head and then you move back into the previous chamber and take a short rest. Claude informs you that, by chance, he had already collected the Naga's head for "research" purposes. After an hour or so, you return to the Hag's chamber and present her with the Naga's head.

True to her word, she gives you the following pieces of lore:
>In the _Predator Pools_, vats hold power over life.
>
>In the _Golem Laboratories_, no Red Wizard will enter the glowing green archways.

"But it will do you no good," says Tanjus, "as I now rule all of this zone uncontested. Get them my pretties!" And her giant crabs move to attack.

Ocardo casts _cone of cold_ over the giant crabs. Badger moves in to attack the hag directly. Remy shoots the hag with an arrow. Chas attempts to shooter her with a _guiding bolt_ but misses. The merrow attack Ocardo. The hag uses a _command_ spell to attempt to take control of Badger, but he resists. The crabs attempt to eat Badger and Dave but they are unable to catch them in their claws. Nine gets through and smashes the hag into a pulp. Claude casts a _guiding bolt_ which hits and kills one of the merrow, while Dave uses _Wave_ to _dominate_ a crab. Bobolink jumps into the pool with the merrow and shanks him. And Remy and Badger take down the remaining giant crabs.

Tanjus has the following items:

- a black pearl
- a golden gorget set with aquamarines
- a magic staff
- a glyph key

The staff, you identify as a _staff of charming_. The key is attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone and the _Pools of Devotion_ gate. You also search the debris in the room and find:

- 5 potions
- 2 spell scrolls

You identify the potions as _potions of water breathing_ and the scrolls contain spells of _water walk_.

The passage south from the hag's lair forks southeast and southwest with a white gate blocking the junction. You use the hag's glyph key to open the gate and take the southwest passage. It leads into a large cavern. On the north wall of this cavern is a black stone shrine set with relief carvings of roses. On the wall about a foot above the arcane shrine is a contact stone. To the south is a black gate.

A dread warrior keeps watch here with seven skeleton guards. There are ten human prisoners standing around the shrine in a catatonic state. Neither the guards nor the prisoners react to your presence.

Remy readies an attack on the dread warrior should it make a move. But Bobolink casts a _fireball_ spell into the room destroying most of the skeletons and many of the humans. Badger takes down the last skeleton. Claude casts a _guiding bolt_ on the dread warrior and Remy takes it down with a precision shot. Four of the humans remain alive and Remy finds another glyph key attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone on the dread warrior.

Badger and Ocardo check out the shrine and become entranced by it leaving them debilitated while Remy looks over the ledge into a large circular chamber. An octagonal pool fills this chamber. A slick of blood darkens the water around a stepped stone altar that sits on a broad pillar rising from the pool. Smaller pillars are spread around the central one. An enormous globe of blue liquid is suspended in the air to the north. Four sahuagin stand and chant along with a sahuagin priestess on the altar pillar. Another five sahuagin and two hunter sharks dwell in the pool. And a commoner is bound on the altar and about to be sacrificed.

![fish man](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/177/329/315/636252761683746719.jpeg "Sahuagin")

As the priestess continues her chant, Remy sneaks in and attempts to take the priestess down with a sneak attack. He succeeds in his attack, but the priestess survives and calls for aid as she completes the sacrifice. Meanwhile, Ocardo, still somewhat delirious, summons a barlgura demon. Nine and Chas move into the chamber. The sahuagin attack the demon and Remy. The demon crushes the priestess but also tries to break out of Ocardo's control. Though still dizzy, Ocardo manages to keep control.

Back in the cavern, Claude casts _greater restoration_ on Badger to restore his abilities.

Remy uses his whistle to escape and fly back up to the cavern. Ocardo hits one of the sahuagin with an _eldritch blast_. Badger and Nine both move in to attack. Chas throws _Whelm_. Claude casts another _greater restoration_, this time on Ocardo. The barlgura demon is running amok. Dave uses _Wave_ and attempts to _dominate_ a shark, while Remy and Ocardo continue to fire arrows and _eldritch blasts_ from the ledge. Chas, Badger, and Nine continue attacking hand to hand in the chamber. Nine kills one of the sahuagin. Claude casts _toll the dead_. The demon bashes one of the sahuagin and then breaks out of Ocardo's control.

Dave then uses _Wave_ to _dominate_ the other shark. Remy shoots one of the sahuagin dead, and Ocardo kills another with a blast, and Badger takes down a third with his blades. Nine turns its attention to the demon. Chas throws _Whelm_ while Claude readies a _banishment_ spell. The demon beats some of the stuffing out of Nine, but Dave sends his sharks in to attack and finishes the demon with a strike from _Wave_.

You search the bodies of the dead sahuagin and find the following items:

- a magic dagger
- a headdress of ivory, coral, leather, and gold
- a glyph key attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone

You identify the magic dagger as a _dagger of venom_. Poon Tang teleports back in after returning the dragon turtle to the sea, and takes the dagger.

Remy checks for traps before you move on through the north passage to the next pool. The pool that takes up most of this circular chamber is filled with clear water. Stone pillars rise from the bottom to break the surface. Sets of double doors are spaced evenly around the room's perimeter. Six sahuagin swim along the surface around the edge of the pool. Ocardo detects a sahuagin baron and two hunter sharks swimming deep down. He also detects magic on some of the pillars.

Badger immediately attacks and takes down one of the sahuagin. Poon Tang hits one with an arrow. Ocardo jumps onto one of the magic pillars and becomes paralysed by its magic. Chas targets a sahuagin with a _guiding bolt_ spell while Dave moves in. Claude casts _toll the dead_ on Poon Tang's target and kills it, while Remy hits the sahuagin lit up with Chas' guiding bolt.

The baron swims up and pulls Ocardo into the water where he is torn into by the baron and his sharks. Badger takes out another of the sahuagin from the surface and Poon Tang continues to attack with her bow.

![fish-man with four arms](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/9/100/257/315/636323496465469651.jpeg "The baron")

Under the water, Ocardo manages to break out of the paralysis, while up above, Chas throws _Whelm_ and kills another of the sahuagin and Dave uses _Wave_ to _dominate_ one of the sharks. Claude kills another of the sahuagin with a _guiding bolt_ and Remy kills the last with an arrow.

Under the water, the baron finds himself under attack from one of his own sharks. The baron attacks Ocardo and is boiled in a _hellish rebuke_. Poon Tang and Badger dive in to deal with the remaining shark.

In the pool you find:

- a suit of magical leather armour
- a crown-like helm of ivory, coral, and gold
- a stone coffer
- a glyph key attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone

The stone coffer contains:

- 100 platinum pieces
- 8 large pearls
- a crystal phial containing a magic potion

You identify the potion as a _potion of diminution_.
