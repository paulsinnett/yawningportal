# Dead in Thay: Part 2

Claude explains the nature of the curse on Remy's bow. The first time Remy attacked with the bow, he became focused on that type of creature. (It gives him advantage on attacks against that type of creature but disadvantage on attacks against everything else.) Claude casts _remove curse_ on Remy to break the current curse. If Remy were to fire the bow again, he will be cursed to focus on a that type of creature again. Claude thinks he may be able to remove the curse on the item given time and resources.

You are at a crossroads with doors leading in each direction. Ocardo and Remy decide to try the doors to the east. These doors are inlaid with brass filigree, marking out the shapes of angelic figures. Remy determines that the doors are not trapped and opens them. Magical darkness flows out of the opening and you feel your life draining. Remy backs out of the darkness but Ocardo is able to see into the void. Unfortunately there is nothing to see. You send Nine into the void beyond the doors to see what will happen. The golem begins to float away into the darkness. Ocardo uses his _lightning lure_ to catch Nine before it drifts away. However, instead of damaging the golem, the magical lightning heals its wounds. Ocardo closes the doors and the magical darkness dissipates.

You try the doors to the west next. They open on a well appointed living quarters. Rich tapestries line the walls and standing screens divide the space into smaller sections containing couches, tables, and desks. The room contains four dread warriors, who immediately attack. Claude blasts one with a _sacred flame_ attack. Badger flies into a rage and attacks one of the dread warriors hand to hand.

As if possessed by an external influence a dread warrior's eyes glow white and throws a _fire bolt_ at Badger. Ocardo attacks another with an _eldritch blast_ but again a dread warrior's eyes glow brightly as it throws a _ray of frost_ back.

Whelm is eager to join the battle and has Chas throw it into the mêlée. A large sphere of poisonous yellowy green fog emerges in the corridor and starts to spread slowly among you. Dave is choked by the fog, but he manages to activate Wave's _cube of force_ to create a safe area for you. Nine wades through the poison to attack the dread warriors and Remy manages to skewer one of the warriors with his rapier. The dread warriors attack and slash the golem furiously.

Poon Tang dives into the fray, through the dividing screens, and comes face to face with a hideous but smartly attired lich. "You are a fool to think you can defeat Tarul Var!"

Claude fires a _guiding bolt_ at the creature but he misses. Tarul Var reaches out an touches Poon Tang. She is frozen by his _paralysing touch_.

Badger continues to rage at a dread warrior and slices it into pieces. But Tarul Var, possesses one of the warriors and throws another _fire bolt_ at him. Ocardo hurls an _eldritch blast_ at the lich and Chas throws Whelm. Enraged by this sudden onslaught, Tarul Var casts a out a _circle of death_ around him. You can feel your skin rotting in the necrotic magic.

Claude hits the lich with a _guiding bolt_ and Badger then manages to get a hit on Tarul Var, but the lich uses _benign transposition_ to instantaneously swap positions with one of the dread warriors. Ocardo attempts to strike him down with an _eldritch blast_ but the lich uses a _counterspell_ to neutralise the warlock magic. Chas casts _spiritual weapon_ to keep the dread warriors busy while he heals himself.

Tarul Var casts _Evard's black tentacles_ to fill the room with squirming ebony tentacles. They grab hold of Nine and Chas but Remy manages to evade. Nine manages to fight free but Chas is strangled and knocked unconscious. Claude heals Poon Tang while Badger continues to attack the lich and the last dread warrior. Ocardo blasts them with a _cone of cold_.

"Enough," says Tarul Var, "let me go free and I offer you my glyph, my key, and two pieces of lore."

You decide he is too dangerous to be let free and try to destroy him here. But the lich casts a spell and vanishes from the room. Ocardo rescues Chas from the black tentacles and administers a potion of healing.

Searching the room you find a circle of glowing glyphs above Tarul Var's desk. This is a contact stone and you can use it to contact Syranna in the gatehouse or attune a glyph key to the Abyssal Prisons. Searching the desk you find:

- some letters
- a potion
- an ornate steel key
- a drawer held with an _arcane lock_

The letters are several drafts of a letter to Szass Tam in which Var begs for another chance to bring the Sword Coast under Thayan domination.

Badger attempts to bypass the _arcane lock_ with a _passwall_ spell, but that spell appears to be magically warded here. Instead, Poon Tang decides to smash her way in. Inside the smashed drawer, you find:

- a flat box of black wood that detects as evocation magic
- a gold coffer wrought as a sleeping dragon with eyes of violet garnet

Inside the coffer is:

- 200 platinum pieces
- a dark, smooth river rock which detects as magic

Claude casts _identify_ on the rock. It is a loadstone: a stone cursed to slow and weigh you down should you attempt to attune to it. The box contains parchment. Fortunately, you notice that the top sheet contains explosive runes that trigger if read. You close the box carefully without reading the runes.

A search of the fallen dread warriors turns up:

- two +1 battle axes
- a suit of +1 chain mail

You give the armour to Dave. Ocardo electrocutes Nine a few times to heal it. And the rest of you take a short rest in Tarul Var's Quarters.

After your rest, you spend some time searching the immediate area for Tarul Var's tracks. You find nothing. You backtrack through the room marked _Abyssal Gates_ on your map and back up through the corridor with the pit traps in it, crossing the white gate, and taking the north east fork leading to the area marked _Blood Pens_. The corridor ends in double doors.

The doors open into an area marked _Vermin Halls_ on your map. The sunken floor of this huge hall is covered in dead insects, their dried shells shifting and whispering in a faint breeze. Dozens of demonic faces are carved in the white marble walls of the chamber, slight gusts whistling from each of their open mouths. Down the center of the chamber, toward the doors at the far end, a series of black stone platforms are set like oversized stepping stones.

You decide this must be some form of trap. Ocardo casts _fly_ on himself, Poon, and Badger. Remy uses his whistle. You fly through the hall and open the doors at the far end but find only an empty cupboard. On your way back, you discover secret doors in the south wall. You take the one furthest to the east. It opens into a south passage leading south into a makeshift barracks.

Rough cots scattered across the floor contrast with the décor in the east end of the room, which contains a great seat of white marble. Some of the magic lights are shrouded, so that side of the room is dimly lit.

In the northeast corner is a black gate. West of it is a contact stone.

There are over a dozen Thayans resting here, half are asleep. They are guarded by a wight. Badger and Poon launch an Aerial assault with Badger using _burning hands_ and Poon swooping in to attack with her daggers. Ocardo uses _summon greater demon_ to bring a creature from the Abyss to your aid. With a horrendous drone sound, a chasme demon appears:

![a fly demon](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8/808/372/315/636319262852869119.jpeg "Chasme")

The droning sound knocks several of the Thayans unconscious. The remaining Thayans and the wight attack you and the demon with swords, javelins, and _scorching rays_. Remy defeats the wight with _rakish audacity_. One of the Thayan warriors breaks Ocardo's concentration on the Chasme. Ocardo uses _Blackrazor_ to consume his soul but the Chasme is free of Ocardo's control.

The Thayans continue to battle the Chasme leaving the rest of you free to loot the fallen and assassinate the sleeping. Remy finds 2 platinum pieces on the body of the wight.

With heavy losses on their side, the Thayans defeat the demon and turn their attention back to you. You make short work of the already wounded Thayans. Remy shoots the last warrior who falls back dead onto the throne at the far wall. But there is a click as some mechanism activates and a swarm of poisonous stinging insects pours out of the back of the throne and quickly fills the chamber. You are overwhelmed and Poon Tang is knocked unconscious. Badger uses _gust of wind_ from his magic axe to drive away the insects.

After your battle, the room is destroyed. You search the wreckage and find:

- a glyph key attuned to the _Blood Pens_ zone and the _Swine Run_ gate
- a glyph key attuned to the _Blood Pens_ zone and the _Hatchery_ gate.

You decide to rest after your battle. As you are resting, a Thayan wizard arrives through the black gate escorted by four Thayan warriors and a half dozen prisoners. Remy uses his _panache_ to charm the wizard and convince him that the devastation was the result of Tarul Var's escape. You suggest he leave his prisoners with you and take his warriors to search for Tarul Var within the Doomvault.

You re-open the black gate and allow the prisoners to return to the gatehouse. You also contact Syranna using the contact stones and get her to attune your existing key to the _Blood Pens_ zone and the _Barracks_ gate.

After your rest, you open the west door and open the white gate in the south passage. You cross, and descend the stairs into the area marked _Swine Run_. What once must have been a great hall is now a great swine pen. Three rows of thick pillars support the ceiling. Each pillar is marked with a large X in red paint. Pigs, perhaps hundreds of them, are packed in here, shoulder to shoulder, on the floor. Ten feet above them, skeletal undead stand on a crude bridge of wooden planks, dumping food into the pigpen.

At the bottom of the stairs is a 5 foot high stone slab, separating you from the pigs. You use it to remain concealed from the undead on the walkways and try to slip in among the pigs and pass unnoticed through the double doors at the north end of the west wall of the room. Badger uses his _speak with animals_ to convince one of the pigs to carry him to the door. The rest of you move as best you can, as you are buffeted by the maltreated, hungry, and irritated creatures.

You go back through the _Abyssal Gates_ and rejoin Claude and the others. Claude heals Poon Tang and then you decide to explore to the south of Tarul Var's room. Listening at the doors at the end of the south passage, you can hear a demonic howling. Remy checks for traps and then cautiously open the doors.

The walls of this torture chamber are hung with chains and spears encrusted with black ichor. In a few places, heavy black chains are fastened to the floor. In the northeast corner is a black gate. Here, chained to the floor is a large four armed demon, with two huge pincers, many horns, and very sharp teeth. It is surrounded, and being tortured by, a wight and seven skeletons using enchanted pikes.

Ocardo steps in and casts a _cone of cold_ wiping out most of the skeletons. Badger takes on the wight, while Dave and Nine smash the remaining skeleton into fragments. Remy sneak attacks the wight and takes it down. Ocardo casts _banishment_ to return the tortured demon to its own plane.

Each of the skeletons held a magically enchanted pike. This enchantment will last for one hour. The wight carried a magic +1 pike.
