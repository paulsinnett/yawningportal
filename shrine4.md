# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 4

Due to his earlier poisoning, Badger falls back into an ageless sleep. You use an _elixir of health_ to revive him. The rest of you are suffering once again from the effects of the poison gas. You make your way back to the cat room and go through the passage behind the calendar stone.

As you approach you can hear Bobolink's voice. He is apparently engaged in some kind of scuffle. When you reach the entrance to the treasure room, you find the doorway is blocked by a wall of magical fire. Bobolink seems to be shouting as if engaged in a fight with himself. Remy dives through the wall of fire. He finds two Bobolink's fighting with each other. He tries to grapple one of the Bobolink's, but the gnomes are too elusive for him. Instead he tries to de-activate the _wall of fire_.

Outside, Badger uses _passwall_ on his magic axe to open another doorway into the chamber. He and Poon Tang then capture one of the Bobolinks in a sack. You question the Bobolinks to see which is the real one. It appears, that both have similar knowledge. Remy, who did a module on doppelgängers, attempts to trick the free one into casting a spell, while Badger tries torturing the truth out of the bagged Bobolink by dunking the bag into a liquid metal river. As the bag touches the silvery liquid metal it bursts into flames and generates a stream of obscenities from within. Meanwhile, the other Bobolink cannot use his magic and is revealed as the doppelgänger.

Ocardo throws _eldritch blasts_ at the creature but it dodges his attacks. But Remy skewers it on his rapier and it reverts to its true form. Badger gives the trapped Bobolink a good kick, just to make sure he is real, before letting him free. Claude casts _mend_ on the burned sack.

You then proceed to loot the treasure from the pyramid shaped treasure chests. Each pyramid chest is trapped in a different way, but Remy manages to detect and remove the hazards. Each pyramid contains a collection of valuables. You find thirty coin necklaces; each made from three hundred and sixty pierced silver coins threaded on a piece of gut. You also find:

* six pairs of jade earplugs
* an alabaster statuette
* an agate ring
* eight bracelets of beads
* four small figurines of jade and coral
* three rings carved of jade and alabaster
* fifteen bracelets of obsidian, bronze, and shell
* sixty gems (tourmalines, spinels, and topazes)
* two silver platters
* twenty clay pots, sealed with wax, containing scented oils and perfumes
* several stone bins filled aromatic woods and spices
* two jade bracelets
* an alabaster statuette of a snake woman
* a stone box
* five small figurines carved of coral
* a large jade thumb ring
* eight ceramic miniature flasks of perfumes and essences
* a spell scroll
* a ferret-faced, feathered mask

You make your way back to the surface through the caved in ceiling in the enormous chamber that was the lair of the two-headed snake. Dioica again communicates with the baboons who are content to let you rest in their territory. While you rest, Claude identifies your items and finds that the mask is a magic item that can cast the _disguise self_ spell whenever it is worn, and the spell scroll is _stone shape_. After you have rested, you leave Dioica and Bobolink to commune with nature, while you re-enter the chamber.

You make your way through the bronze double doors and follow the passage to the stairs up. Ocardo's patron, Terry, has gifted him with _eldritch sight_ and he detects warding magic on the stairs. Remy finds the _glyph of warding_ a few steps from the bottom. You suspect this is a trigger for some kind of trap. You are careful to cross the glyph without touching the steps beneath it.

At the top of the stairs is a passage leading west, then north, and finally connecting with a corridor. At the eastern end of this corridor are double doors. At the western end is a pile of golden coins heaped on the floor. On top of the gold rests a skull missing its lower jaw. In the right eye socket, a black spider has made a home. Several bones are piled with the coins, and the hilt of a broken sword thrusts up from the mass. Again, Ocardo detects magic; this time it is from the school of illusion. Remy suspects Bobolink is behind it. He uses _mage hand_ to investigate. As soon as the hand touches the gold, it ejects a cloud of yellow spores. When the cloud clears, you find there is no gold; just a patch of yellow mould covered by an illusion.

You search the area around the mould and find a dark stain on the floor in the north west corner, marking the location of a secret door. The door swings on a horizontal pivot and provides a crawl space into a secret passage. Beyond the secret door, the passage bends around to the left. At the end of a narrow corridor hangs an ornate mirror, and a door is set in the eastern wall next to it. Ocardo and Badger look into the mirror. Badger senses nothing, but Ocardo sees a feathered warrior emerge from it and move to attack. Meanwhile, the rest of you see Ocardo freeze. Remy tries to slap Ocardo out of his trance, while Badger smashes the mirror with his axe.

The door seems to be very heavy, and it has many glyphs carved upon it. In the center of the door is carved an eagle killing a serpent. Two stone warriors dressed in loincloths and wearing panther masks are sculpted into the door posts. Beyond the door is a wide foyer that leads into a circular room. On the south wall of this hall is a jade death mask affixed at chest height.

Taking up the middle of the chamber is a cross-shaped dais with sets of stairs leading up to it along each of the four ends. In the center of the dais rises a cylindrical structure that appears to be made of transparent walls of crystal enclosing an oddly carved, stone pillar.

The stairs that face the room's entrance are carved with the heads of many gods. The steps on the north side are bloodstained, and atop the landing stands a statue of a warrior. The stairs to the east, across the room, are partly obscured by shadow. The southern staircase is luminescent, appearing to change colors in the light. Tucked into each nook where the arms of the cross come together is a low shelf on which are placed small offerings: silver bracelets, earrings, neck collars, anklets, piles of coral beads, and silver and jade statuettes.

Ocardo detects magic from the cylindrical structure and the steps leading up to it. Remy tries to climb the southern stairs but he finds that the stairs change colour constantly and he can't make any progress. Badger attempts to climb the shelves to bypass the stairs but gets pushed away by an invisible force. Remy then tries the northern steps. The warrior statue animates and flies into the air:

![a picture of a suit of animated armour](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8/853/205/315/636320075427677507.jpeg "Warrior statue")

Remy and Ocardo manage to shoot the armour down with magic arrows and eldritch blasts. Claude examines some of the offerings, and as he does so, the door seals behind you, and you hear a voice seeming to come from everywhere in the chamber. "Interlopers, you have trespassed on my sacred chapel. For this affront, retribution has already begun, for you are now breathing a toxic gas which will kill you shortly. It is possible your actions were not from malice or greed, but just idle curiosity. Therefore, you will find the cure upon the stone in the middle of the dais, if you can solve the puzzle to reach it by the proper route. Choose your path wisely, and act quickly."

You feel yourselves becoming weaker. You ascend the northern stairs to touch the dais and you hear the voice again, "So you have passed the first test. Perhaps you are not the fools you first seemed. But it will take the best tool of your most clever person to breach these crystal walls. Your time is running out."

Ocardo touches Shatterspike to the surface of the cylinder. As he moves it across the surface he detects a hairline crack. He pushes the magic blade into it. A gap opens up revealing the top of a pillar on which is a potion bottle.

"So you have reached my altar, but your time is nearly exhausted and the cure is just beyond your reach. Trust your souls to the gods, foolish mortals."

You try to reach the potion but there is an invisible barrier. Badger touches a symbol of his bear totem animal against the wall of force. It disappears. You grab the potion, but as you do so, a wing serpent materialises and flies out into the chamber. The creature smiles and thanks you for freeing it from its long imprisonment. It introduces itself as Kukulkan.

![a picture of a winged serpent](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/257/245/315/636252768143323827.jpeg "Kukulkan")

The potion you took is a _potion of healing_. Kukulkan also gives you a _balance of harmony_ and the gems needed to operate it, a _mirror of the past_, and a _periapt of wound closure_. It also frees Badger from his 5,000 year sleeping curse.

Kukulkan flies away to freedom. You take the jade death mask and the offerings, and return to the corridor. You go through the double doors into the room beyond. This room is decorated with a bizarre diorama depicting the land of the dead. Small, brightly painted clay statues have been placed about the room to represent the inhabitants of this realm and the unfortunate people they have taken into their care.

In the center of the room, the floor rises to form a small hill. A group of small figures seem to be struggling to roll a boulder up the hill, while a devil drives them on. Above the hill in the ceiling is a glowing spot that illuminates the entire chamber with an eerie silver light.

A cobblestone path leads from the western door to the foot of the hill. A similar path runs eastward and then veers south. Sections of the diorama around the perimeter of the room depict different environments in the land of the dead.

In the western end of the room is a region of burning sands. There devils torture those who have been unfortunate enough to fall into their hands.

Along the southern side is a grassy plain where people frolic and hunt antelope and deer.

North of the grassy plain and south of the hill, the floor opens into a model of a canyon. A river of lava flows down it while flames lick the walls.

East of the hill, in a side area of the room, is a counterpart to this fiery canyon — an icy waste.

To the north of the hill is a putrid, bubbling marsh where figures strive to keep their heads above the surface.

From out of the marsh a black, torpid river wends its way past the northern edge of the hill and flows west to pour over the lip of a steam-filled chasm in the northwest corner of the room. Within this dark chasm, worms pursue the fleeing forms of naked people.

In the south corner of the room on the eastern wall is a barred door. You stick to the paths and make your way to the door. You remove the bar and enter. Beyond the door is a modest-sized room with a lumpy pile of earthy material in the middle of the floor. Across from the door in the south-east corner, a glazed flask rests on a small shelf. In the northwest and northeast corners are two more shelves on which rest a small urn and a thin stone cylinder.

You enter the room. An eye opens in the earthy lump, then another, and another, until many differently sized eyes stare at you. All about the eyes, fanged drooling mouths open and create a cacophony of babbling.

![a picture of a blob with many eyes and mouths](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/116/300/360/totyp-03-12.png "Gibbering mouther")

Ocardo is unaffected by the creature. He attacks. But the rest of you are driven mad by the noise. Remy attacks Ocardo, Badger stands and drools, and Poon Tang is confused. The creature also spits blinding spittle at you. Poon Tang is blinded. She runs blindly out of the room and into the icy wasteland of the diorama. There, she begins to freeze. Her weapons freeze to her hands.

Remy manages to snap out of his madness and attacks. Meanwhile Badger is bitten by the creature and a curse from his magic axe makes him go berserk. Ocardo manages to kill the creature but is attacked by Badger. Ocardo attempts to grapple him but can't restrain him. Claude is at a loss on how to break this spell. Poon Tang snaps out of her madness and is able to block Badger in the room by reshaping the stone around the door. When Badger has finally calmed down, you release him. Claude uses a _remove curse_ spell to allow him to discard the axe.

The flask contains a dried potion. The cylinder is a magic rod. The urn holds a dried heart that is radiating transmutation magic. Ocardo eats the heart and gains the permanent ability to understand the speech of snakes and yuan-ti. Claude identifies the dried potion as a _potion of hill giant strength_ and the rod is a _+1 rod of the pact keeper_.

You climb the hill to examine the glowing light. The top of the hill is surrounded by a magical force that pushes against anyone climbing it. With the help of some rope, you manage to get to the top. The light is coming from the walls of a chute that glows in the dark above you. You boost Remy up to investigate. Inside, he is attacked by a giant spider but he manages to skewer it on his rapier before it can poison him. You climb the chute and emerge in a room above.

This room is small and plainly decorated. On the north and south sides are fountains made of bronze-inlaid marble. The southern one is cracked, and only dry limy deposits remain in it. The northern one contains about two feet of dark water, fed by a trickle that falls from the top of the fountain. In the water, the white, gauzy form of a crayfish lies on a bed of lime encrustations.

To the west, stairs lead up out of the room, and to either side of the stairs along the west wall are narrow, dust covered ledges. You move towards the stairs but you are attacked by a weird water creature that emerges from the fountain.

![a picture of a creature made of water](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/16/592/256/315/636376367494214976.jpeg "Weird water creature")

Poon Tang throws the sleeping dust poison at the creature. It appears immune to the effect. The creature captures Claude in its watery tentacles and attempts to drown him. The combined attacks of Remy, Badger, and Ocardo, destroy it. In the fountain, beneath the crayfish shell, you find a platinum key and chain.

You head up the stairs out of the room and into the next chamber. In the middle of this chamber is what appears to be the withered, preserved form of a centaur mounted on a slab of marble. Tinted green and decked out in lacquered leather, feathers, and copper wire jewellery, he faces the western entrance to this chamber. The centaur holds a bronze-hafted pike tipped with a broad, blue-gray, flame-shaped spearhead.

Scattered around the room are jewellery and knick-knacks, made of beaten copper, cut and polished obsidian, shells, quartz, and coral. Much of this treasure is at the feet of the centaur, symbolically being trod underfoot. Two tall urns shaped like wicker baskets stand along the north wall, each one filled with river stones. 

Remy pokes the mummy with his rapier and it animates:

![a picture of a mummified centaur](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/118/250/416/totyp-03-14.png "Centaur mummy")

It fixes Ocardo with its _dreadful glare_. Ocardo resists the magic and gains temporary immunity for the next day. You all attack and the mummy dishes out damage from its hooves, pike, and _mummy rot_. Eventually it hits Ocardo and gets a _hellish rebuke_ which burns it to ashes.

You find eight hundred pieces of cheap jewellery scattered around the room. In the urns, buried beneath the stones, you find:

* two crushed silver masks
* an electrum serpent bracelet
* a broken marble statue of a monkey
* four silver hairpins set with jade

The western exit is blocked by a wall of green polished stone. You push the wall over. You follow the passage west and around to the north until you reach a tunnel. This five-foot-diameter passage is dry and dusty, and it shows no sign of having been used for ages. Near the top of the corridor walls, about three feet from the ceiling, stone lintels run the length of the passage. The corridor abruptly widens to a cube fifteen feet on a side with a corrugated floor. In the ceiling of this area, a bronze, circular trapdoor is set. The cover is latched shut.

In the four corners of this foyer are sets of metal rungs forming a ladder that leads up and across the arched ceiling to the trapdoor. The rungs are broken in several places, leaving rusty spikes. On the other side of this area, the corridor continues.

You try opening the hatch. It releases a whirlwind which blows you off your feet and into the rusty spikes. With some effort you manage to close the hatch again and continue on your way north.

Before you is a foyer, ten feet wide and twenty feet long. A narrow hall connects with this area on the south side, and on the north end a five-foot-wide staircase leads up.

A wheel is set horizontally half into the wall in the southwest corner. This wheel appears to be a crank. Above the wheel, a bronze lever is set in the wall, angled downward. You turn the wheel which opens a secret door up the stairs. You lock the wheel in place by pulling the lever, but this also drops a portcullis barring your way. You find a small keyhole in the wall beside the portcullis and your platinum key fits this lock. You use the key which opens the portcullis like a gate. You then make your way up and out through the secret door.

You have reached the outside at the top of the pyramid. This was apparently a large temple of some sort. Once a major building, all that remains are the back wall and enough of the roof to shelter the altar. All else seems closed off by fallen debris. Several pillars have fallen and they litter the floor. Sunlight filters through holes in the roof, thirty-five feet overhead, which is a maze of chips and cracks. The back wall is covered by a bas-relief of a giant bat-thing, nine feet tall, with a wingspan of twenty feet. In front of this wall is an altar stone, carved to represent a mass of squirming rats, weasels, and worms. On the front of the altar is the head of a screaming bat. Jutting above the altar on either side are a pair of sharp-edged, metal bat-wings, eight feet long. The floor in front of the altar is worn smooth.

![a picture of an altar carved in the form of squirming rats, and with large bat wings on either side](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/119/850/549/totyp-03-15.png "Altar")

You search the area and keep an eye out for any vampires. However, while you wait, you are attacked by a giant hyena. You take it down with a combination of weapons strikes and hell fire. A closer inspection of the altar reveals handholds at the front and hinges at the back. You try to lift it, but the razor sharp bat wings swing out and you are forced jump away to avoid being cut in two. You try again from a kneeling position allowing the wings to pass harmlessly above you. Beneath the altar is an eight foot deep pit in which are many items of value and two bodies cut in half. You find:

* twenty thousand silver pieces
* fifty silver chased goblets
* twenty gold-plated statuettes
* forty embossed silver chalices and servings
* eighty pieces of jewellery
* fifty mother of pearl pieces
* a jade placard bearing the image of a vampire
* a marble statue of a reclining figure

You rejoin Dioica and Bobolink and take your treasure back to Port Nyanzaru. There you attempt to find passage back to The Sword Coast.
