# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 4

Due to his earlier poisoning, Badger falls back into an ageless sleep. And the rest of you are suffering once again from the effects of the poison gas.

You make your way back to the cat room and go through the passage behind the calendar stone. As you approach you can hear Bobolink's voice. He is apparently engaged in some kind of scuffle. When you reach the entrance to the treasure room, you find the doorway is blocked by a wall of magical fire. Bobolink seems to be shouting as if engaged in a fight with himself. Remy dives through the wall of fire. He finds two Bobolink's fighting with each other. He tries to grapple one of the Bobolink's, but the gnome are too elusive for him. Instead he tries to de-activate wall of fire.

Outside, Badger uses the passwall spell on his magic axe to open another doorway into the chamber. He and Poon Tang then capture one of the Bobolink's in a sack. You then question the Bobolink's to find out which is the real one. It appears, that both have similar knowledge. Remy, who did a module on doppelgängers, attempts to trick the free one into attempting a spell, while Badger tries torturing the truth out of the bagged Bobolink by dunking the bag into a liquid metal river. As the bag touches the silvery liquid metal it bursts into flames and generates a stream of obscenities from within. Meanwhile, the other Bobolink cannot use his magic and is revealed as the doppelgänger.

Ocardo throws eldritch blasts at the creature but it dodges his attacks. Remy skewers the creature on his rapier as it reverts to its true form. Badger gives the trapped Bobolink a good kick, 'to make sure he is real,' before letting him free.

You then proceed to loot the treasure from the pyramid shaped treasure chests. Each pyramid chest is trapped in different ways, but Remy manages to detect and remove the dangers. Each pyramid contains a collection of valuables. You find thirty coin necklaces; each made from three hundred and sixty pierced silver coins threaded on a piece of gut. You also find:

* six pairs of jade earplugs
* an alabaster statuette
* an agate ring
* eight bracelets of beads
* four small figurines of jade and coral
* three rings carved of jade and alabaster
* fifteen bracelets of obsidian, bronze, and shell
* sixty gems (tourmalines, spinels, and topazes)
* two silver platters


You make your way back to the surface through the caved in ceiling in the Chamber of the Second Sun. Dioica communicates with the baboons who are content to let you rest in their territory.
