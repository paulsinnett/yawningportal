# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 4

Due to his earlier poisoning, Badger falls back into an ageless sleep. And the rest of you are suffering once again from the effects of the poison gas.

You make your way back to the cat room and go through the passage behind the calendar stone. As you approach you can hear Bobolink's voice. He is apparently engaged in some kind of scuffle. When you reach the entrance to the treasure room, you find the doorway is blocked by a wall of magical fire. Bobolink seems to be shouting as if engaged in a fight with himself. Remy dives through the wall of fire. He finds two Bobolink's fighting with each other. He tries to grapple one of the Bobolink's, but the gnome are too elusive for him. Instead he tries to de-activate the _wall of fire_.

Outside, Badger uses _passwall_ on his magic axe to open another doorway into the chamber. He and Poon Tang then capture one of the Bobolinks in a sack. You then question the Bobolinks to find out which is the real one. It appears, that both have similar knowledge. Remy, who did a module on doppelgängers, attempts to trick the free one into attempting a spell, while Badger tries torturing the truth out of the bagged Bobolink by dunking the bag into a liquid metal river. As the bag touches the silvery liquid metal it bursts into flames and generates a stream of obscenities from within. Meanwhile, the other Bobolink cannot use his magic and revealed as a doppelgänger.

Ocardo throws _eldritch blasts_ at the creature but it dodges his attacks. Remy skewers the creature on his rapier and it reverts to its true form. Badger gives the trapped Bobolink a good kick, 'to make sure he is real,' before letting him free. Claude casts _mend_ on the burned sack.

You then proceed to loot the treasure from the pyramid shaped treasure chests. Each pyramid chest is trapped in a different way, but Remy manages to detect and remove the dangers. Each pyramid contains a collection of valuables. You find thirty coin necklaces; each made from three hundred and sixty pierced silver coins threaded on a piece of gut. You also find:

* six pairs of jade earplugs
* an alabaster statuette
* an agate ring
* eight bracelets of beads
* four small figurines of jade and coral
* three rings carved of jade and alabaster
* fifteen bracelets of obsidian, bronze, and shell
* sixty gems (tourmalines, spinels, and topazes)
* two silver platters
* twenty clay pots, sealed with wax, containing scented oils and perfumes
* several stone bins filled aromatic woods and spices
* two jade bracelets
* an alabaster statuette of a snake woman
* a stone box
* five small figurines carved of coral
* a large jade thumb ring
* eight ceramic miniature flasks of perfumes and essences
* a spell scroll of stone shape
* a ferret-faced, feathered mask

You make your way back to the surface through the caved in ceiling in the enormous chamber that was the lair of the two-headed snake. Dioica again communicates with the baboons who are content to let you rest in their territory. While you rest, Claude identifies your items and finds that the mask is a magic item that can cast the _disguise self_ spell whenever it is worn. After you have rested, you leave Dioica and Bobolink to commune with nature, while you re-enter the chamber. 

You make your way through the bronze double doors and follow the passage to the stairs up. Ocardo's patron, Terry, has gifted him with eldritch sight and he detects warding magic on the stairs. Remy finds a _glyph of warding_ a few steps from the bottom. You suspect this is a trigger for some kind of trap. You are careful to cross the glyph without touching the steps beneath it.

At the top of the stairs is a passage leading west, then north and connecting with a corridor. At the eastern end of this corridor are double doors. At the western end of this corridor is a pile of golden coins heaped on the floor. On top of the gold rests a skull missing its lower jaw. In the right eye socket, a black spider has made a home. Several bones are piled with the coins, and the hilt of a broken sword thrusts up from the mass. Again, Ocardo detects magic; this time it is from the school of illusion. Remy suspects Bobolink. He uses _mage hand_ to investigate. As soon as the hand touches the 'gold' it ejects a cloud of yellow spores. When the cloud clears you find there is no gold here, just a patch of yellow mould and an illusion spell.

You search the area around the mould and find a dark stain on the floor in the north west corner. This gives away the location of a secret door. The door swings on a horizontal pivot and provides a crawl space into a secret passage. Beyond the secret door, the passage bends around to the left. At the end of a narrow corridor hangs an ornate mirror, and a door is set in the eastern wall next to it. Ocardo and Badger look into the mirror. Badger senses nothing, but Ocardo sees a feathered warrior emerge from it and move to attack. Meanwhile, the rest of you see Ocardo freeze. Remy tries to slap him out of his trance while Badger smashes the mirror with his axe.

The door seems to be very heavy, and it has many glyphs carved upon it. In the center of the door is carved an eagle killing a serpent. Two stone warriors dressed in loincloths and wearing panther masks are sculpted into the door posts. Beyond the door is a wide foyer that leads into a circular room. On the south wall of this hall is a jade death mask affixed at chest height.

Taking up the middle of the chamber is a cross-shaped dais with sets of stairs leading up to it along each of the four ends. In the center of the dais rises a cylindrical structure that appears to be made of transparent walls of crystal enclosing an oddly carved, stone pillar.

The stairs that face the room's entrance are carved with the heads of many gods. The steps on the north side are bloodstained, and atop the landing stands a statue of a warrior. The stairs to the east, across the room, are partly obscured by shadow. The southern staircase is luminescent, appearing to change colors in the light. Tucked into each nook where the arms of the cross come together is a low shelf on which are placed small offerings: silver bracelets, earrings, neck collars, anklets, piles of coral beads, and silver and jade statuettes.

Ocardo detects magic from the cylindrical structure and the steps leading up to it. Remy tries to climb the southern stairs but he finds that the stairs change colour constantly and he can't make any progress. Badger attempts to climb the shelves to bypass the stairs but gets pushed away by an invisible force. Remy tries the northern steps and the warrior statue animates and flies into the air:

![a picture of a suit of animated armour](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8/853/205/315/636320075427677507.jpeg "Warrior statue")

Remy and Ocardo manage to shoot the armour down with magic arrows and eldritch blasts. Claude examines some of the offerings, and as he does so, the door seals behind you, and you hear a voice seeming to come from everywhere in the chamber. "Interlopers, you have trespassed on my sacred chapel. For this affront, retribution has already begun, for you are now breathing a toxic gas which will kill you shortly. It is possible your actions were not from malice or greed, but just idle curiosity. Therefore, you will find the cure upon the stone in the middle of the dais, if you can solve the puzzle to reach it by the proper route. Choose your path wisely, and act quickly."

You feel yourselves becoming weaker. You ascend the northern stairs to touch the dais and you hear the voice again, "So you have passed the first test. Perhaps you are not the fools you first seemed. But it will take the best tool of your most clever person to breach these crystal walls. Your time is running out."

Ocardo touches Shatterspike to the surface of the cylinder. As he moves it across the surface he detects a hairline crack. He pushes Shatterspike into it and a gap opens up revealing the top of a pillar on which is a potion bottle.

"So you have reached my altar, but your time is nearly exhausted and the cure is just beyond your reach. Trust your souls to the gods, foolish mortals."

You try to reach the potion but there is an invisible barrier. Badger touches a symbol of his bear totem animal against the wall of force and it disappears. You grab the potion, but as you do so, a wing serpent materialises and flies out into the chamber. The creature smiles and thanks you for freeing it from its long imprisonment. It introduces itself as Kukulkan.

The potion you took is a _potion of healing_. Kukulkan also gives you a _balance of harmony_ and the gems needed to operate it, a _mirror of the past_, and a _periapt of wound closure_. It also frees Badger from his 5,000 year sleeping curse. It flies away to freedom.

You take the jade death mask and the offerings and return to the corridor to go through the double doors into the room beyond. This room is decorated with a bizarre diorama depicting the land of the dead. Small, brightly painted clay statues have been placed about the room to represent the inhabitants of this realm and the unfortunate people they have taken into their care.

In the center of the room, the floor rises to form a small hill. A group of small figures seem to be struggling to roll a boulder up the hill, while a devil drives them on. Above the hill in the ceiling is a glowing spot that illuminates the entire chamber with an eerie silver light.

A cobblestone path leads from the western door to the foot of the hill. A similar path runs eastward and then veers south. Sections of the diorama around the perimeter of the room depict different environments in the land of the dead.

In the western end of the room is a region of burning sands. There devils torture those who have been unfortunate enough to fall into their hands.

Along the southern side is a grassy plain where people frolic and hunt antelope and deer.

North of the grassy plain and south of the hill, the floor opens into a model of a canyon. A river of lava flows down it while flames lick the walls.

East of the hill, in a side area of the room, is a counterpart to this fiery canyon — an icy waste.

To the north of the hill is a putrid, bubbling marsh where figures strive to keep their heads above the surface.

From out of the marsh a black, torpid river wends its way past the northern edge of the hill and flows west to pour over the lip of a steam-filled chasm in the northwest corner of the room. Within this dark chasm, worms pursue the fleeing forms of naked people.

In the south corner of the room on the eastern wall is a barred door. You stick to the paths and make your way to the door. You remove the bar and enter. Beyond the door is a modest-sized room with a lumpy pile of earthy material in the middle of the floor. Across from the door in the south-east corner, a glazed flask rests on a small shelf. In the northwest and northeast corners are two more shelves on which rest a small urn and a thin stone cylinder.

You enter the room to examine the contents. An eye opens in the earthy lump. Then another and another until many differently sized eyes stare at you. All about the eyes, fanged drooling mouths open and begin to create a cacophony of babbling.

Ocardo is unaffected by the creature and attacks it. But the others are driven mad by the noise. Remy attacks Ocardo, Badger stands and drools, and Poon Tang is confused. The creature also spits blinding spittle at Poon Tang and she is blinded. She runs blindly out of the room and into the icy wasteland of the diorama. There she begins to freeze and her weapons freeze to her hands.

Remy manages to snap out of his madness and attack. Meanwhile Badger is bitten by the creature and the power in his magic axe makes him go berserk. Ocardo manages to kill the creature, but is then attacked by Badger who is now out of control. Ocardo attempts to grapple him but can't restrain him. Claude is at a loss on how to break this spell. Poon Tang snaps out of her madness and is able to block Badger in the room by reshaping the stone around the door. When Badger has finally calmed down, you release him, and Claude uses a _remove curse_ spell to allow him to discard the axe.
