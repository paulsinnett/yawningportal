# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 2

With his exertions, planning and carrying out attacks on the undead, and collecting the loot, Badger falls asleep. Claude examines him as he's giving out his healing. He declares that Badger can't be roused. He appears to be in a state of magical suspended animation and that it would take some time to figure out what it causing it. You decide, as you are not yet free of the poisoned air, you can't afford to take the time right now to diagnose his condition. And you can't leave him behind so Poon Tang agrees to carry him in a sack.
