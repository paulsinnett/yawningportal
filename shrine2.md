# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Part 2

With his exertions, planning and carrying out attacks on the undead, and collecting the loot, Badger suddenly falls asleep. Claude examines him as he's healing the rest of you. He declares that Badger can't be roused. He appears to be in a state of magical suspended animation and that it would take some time to figure out what it causing it. You decide, as you are not yet free of the poisoned air, you can't afford to take the time right now to diagnose his condition. And you can't leave him behind so Poon Tang agrees to carry him in a sack. As Badger was carrying the light, Claude now uses his light spell to light the way.

You return to the large octagonal chamber and try the other exits. The landing at the foot of a short flight of steps is filled with mud and silt that partially blocks the door leading north. The door is meant to open inward, for there are hinges on this side and a large grip to pull on. But the door wont budge with the silt piled up behind it. You attempt to clear the silt but it is semi-liquid and quickly flows back to refill any hole. Instead, you try the passage west.

The passage runs 30 feet before leading down some stairs to a door. Remy searches carefully for traps but finds none. Beyond the room is wet, and the walls are covered with a slimy, white build-up. There is about an inch and a half of water and mud blanketing the floor. Many overturned pedestals and pieces of broken statuary lie on the floor, partially buried in the mud. Opposite the entrance to this room is another door.

Only one pedestal remains standing, in the northwest corner. On it sits a small, metallic, three-sided pyramid. Overhead in the shadow-draped ceiling are inlaid coloured tiles depicting a starry sky and forming strange patterns in the areas above the pedestals. Again Remy searches carefully for traps but finds no danger. He takes the silver pyramid. It represents the god of the moon and lightning, Apocatequil.

You open the door and continue to explore the hallway beyond. The walls and ceiling of this hallway are coated with slime, and the floor of the passage is covered with a layer of mud. Through this muck a steady stream of water trickles northward. The stucco on the walls is flaking off, and there are glowing silver tracks in the slime criss-crossing the walls and ceiling.

Along the east wall of the passage stands a twelve-foot-tall stone statue of a man outfitted in fine clothing and holding a stone tray in his raised arms. Its eyes appear to be black gemstones; the right one droops out of its socket, balancing on the statue's cheek. From behind the left shoulder protrudes the hilt of a weapon, most likely a sword. The stone tray, as well as the forehead and the nose of the statue, are chipped and scratched.

![a large stone statue holding a tray](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/110/300/785/totyp-03-05.png "Statue")

You all stand ready to attack while Remy uses his mage hand to take the gems. Each eye is a piece of polished obsidian. However the mage hand is too weak to budge the sword. Dioica notices that the statue looks top heavy and suspects that it may topple if one of you should climb it. Instead she pushes it over, causing it to break into pieces and exposing a narrow passage behind it, about 4 feet above the floor. Claude takes the sword which is in fine condition, made of laminated wood, and inset with jagged teeth of obsidian.

You ignore the passage for now and continue to the door at the north end of the hallway. The doors are made of bronze and are tinted blue from oxidation. Just inside the doorway are two small alcoves. Each space contains an old fountain, cracked and crusted with lime. Around the fountain in the eastern alcove, a heap of rubbish litters the floor. The fountain in the western alcove still holds some green scummy water, in which something moves.

You find an amulet made of brass and chrysoprase engraved with Olman writing in the eastern fountain. But you are attacked by a swarm of rats nesting in the rubbish around the base. Ocardo, splatters the rats all up the walls with his eldritch blast. Meanwhile Dioica finds some bullfrogs raising a brood of tadpoles in the western fountain.

A short hall ending in descending steps leads to the central chamber, which is flooded. A dark, foul pool covers the entire floor. A central hall, flanked by narrow aisles, is defined by two rows of massive square columns. The walls are coated with slime, and there are glowing silver lines etched across them. From what you can see of the chamber's walls, the stone appears to be crudely worked.

Two corroded bronze braziers stand in the pool. Toward the middle of the room, two broken urns, each apparently once about four feet tall, poke up out of the water. In the darkness on the eastern wall appears to be an enormous growth of an overall greenish hue that gives off the same silvery gleam as the slime trails.

Dioica is first to dare to enter the water. The water is polluted with lime and slowly begins to eat away at your clothing. Ocardo joins her and wades over to the eastern wall, where he falls into a moat which runs around the outside of the room. The blob appears to laugh at Ocardo's misfortune.

By moving a brazier to the northern end of the pool and balancing on top, you are able to jump across to the steps on the other side and ascend to bronze double doors. Beyond the doors lies a passageway leading east and then south to another door. This passageway is slime-covered, and a stream of water trickles away from the door. There is condensation on the walls, door, and ceiling, some of which drips down on you. A quiet sound of dripping and splashing echoes in the corridor. This door is tightly sealed and appears to be warped outward or wedged shut. The door's hinges are mounted on this side.

Remy checks for traps and finds none. However the door is jammed shut and you are unable to open it. You decide, instead, to backtrack to the narrow passage behind the statue. Water beads collect upon the walls of this narrow passage, and the flooring is cold and damp. A low ceiling, only five feet tall, further cramps this dank place. At the northern end of the passage is a block of stone mounted on a central pivot, which has been wedged partially open by accumulated debris. Beyond this is a hall running east. This hall is strewn with mud and flotsam. Water accumulates in the center of the corridor and flows westward to where the stone block in the southern wall has shifted out of place. The corridor turns north, and the flow of water follows it, then goes under a door made of bronze-bound wood. The door has a handle and a keyhole.

Remy checks for traps and finds none. Opening the door reveals stairs going down into a small room. A pool of water fills the entire chamber. Another door is across the way, but only the top 3 inches of it can be seen above the water. This you reason must be the stuck door. From this side you are able to release the door and the water washes out through the passage north and back around into the flooded room to the west. But you find no treasures here.

You continue east to another set of double doors. A faint, melodious sound comes from beyond. It is difficult to tell whether it is someone singing or the echoing of dripping water in a great cavern. Remy checks for traps and then carefully opens the doors. The room is lit by a soft light that reveals a section of rocky beach. Beyond the beach is a pool of glowing water, filling half the room and framed by a crystal cavern. Green fronds can be seen in the pool. Light seems to flow from everywhere, the pool and walls glistening like soft moonlight. On the far side of the pool is a set of doors carved with a sun symbol. Sitting on the beach in front of the crystalline pool is a woman, young and slim, with long golden hair and pale white skin. She radiates a soft silvery light even through her shawl, white as the froth of waves. She is singing a strange melody in an unrecognisable language. After finishing her song, she enters the water in a long, arching dive.

Remy calls to the woman in the pool. He detects something fey about her nature. She is almost transparent while in the water. She says that she is here alone with 'Chac', her pet eel. She tries to convince you to enter the pool. "Come in, the water's lovely." But, given your experience with the succubus, you wisely decide to avoid her and walk on a shallow ledge around to the other side. You leave her laughing and singing to Chac and open the doors into a flooded hall. As you continue eastwards the water gets shallower and then turns north and up some more steps to a set of bronze doors. These doors have keyholes but are unlocked. Remy checks for traps but finds none. So you continue into a great hallway beyond.

This hallway is twenty feet wide and has piles of rubble and debris scattered along its length. The walls are covered with frescoes. The south wall displays scenes of a battle between natives and invaders.

The north wall depicts people questing for a new land; their experiences during the journey include crossing treacherous mountains, sailing over storm-tossed seas, and receiving the guidance of the gods in their battles to keep their homeland free from invasions. In the center of the wall is a painting of a pyramid with a temple atop it and the sun shining over the land.

Double bronze doors stand in the eastern end of the south wall. Down the hall to the west is an archway carved in the form of twining serpents. Beyond it, the corridor continues on into shadow. The party head west through the arch and smack into a wall. The corridor is an illusion. However on either side of the arch is a small niche. Claude investigates and gets trapped. Remy manages to free him, and then you go back to the painting of the pyramid. Claude is suspicious of the picture of the sun and finds that it conceals a secret door. The passage leading north is 8 feet above the floor. The wall at this end of this corridor has a bas relief sculpture of a warrior armed with a spear and shield. The shield, which rests on the floor, resembles a sundial, complete with a marker standing out from the wall. Etched on the shield's surface are runes in Olman script.

The corridor is high-ceilinged and decorated with sculptures mounted on the walls. Two corridors branch off from the main hall, a narrow one to the east and another to the west. The statuary that adorns the walls consists of four sculpted heads of animals. Each one is six feet above the floor and two to three feet in diameter. Opposite the passage that leads east is the stylized head of a coyote, and across from the hallway going west is the head of a grinning bear. Near the south end of the corridor, the head of a bison is mounted on the east wall.

At the north end of the area, on the west wall, is what appears to be the head of an eagle, with its beak open. Something shines from within the eagle's mouth.

![a corridor with animal heads on the walls opposite different passageways](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/111/300/389/totyp-03-06.png "Hall of statues")

Remy investigates the eagle's mouth. He finds that it is trapped but he manages to remove a large gold ring by jamming the mouth open with a dagger. The ring, it seems, must have been made for a giant. As Remy is retrieving the ring, Claude notices a light floating into the distance in the near passage to the east. He follows it but turns back as he believes it to be leading him into danger.

You decide to continue north. The corridor turns east at the north end. Along both sides of the corridor, deep in shadows, human figures appear to be floating above the floor. As you approach, you see that the figures seemingly suspended in the air are actually withered corpses standing upright on a ledge two feet above the floor. There are over a dozen of these corpses.

You try poking them but they seem quite dead. You decide to continue until you are about half way along the corridor when suddenly the corpses begin to animate. Dioica casts erupting earth to bury these zombies in a fountain of churned earth and stone. Bobolink turns himself invisible. You dispatch the zombies relatively quickly, but you take some hits from the zombies. Fortunately no-one contracts sewer plague. Claude revives you all with a prayer of healing.

The corridor leads north again and ends in a heavy bronze door. Remy checks for traps but finds none. You open the door into a lozenge-shaped room. Colourful glyphs are scribed on the western wall. There are two sideboards against the walls to the east.

In the middle of the chamber are two stone divans, each with a human figure stretched out on it. Between the divans is a low stone table holding a flask and two goblets, all made of crystal. In the bottom of the crystal flask is a quantity of silvery dust.

The figures on the divans are a male and female, each about middle-aged and perfectly preserved. They are very still, dust-covered, and apparently dead. Their bodies are covered with dry snakeskin. The female wears a silver bracelet and holds what looks to be an ivory wand. The male has an amulet of electrum resting on his chest, inset with a red stone of considerable size.

![a woman lying covered in dust with an ivory wand in her hand](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/112/300/389/totyp-03-07.png "Apparently dead female")

Remy attempts to take the ivory wand but suddenly the sleepers awake. They say first in Olman and then in an ancient dialect of the common tongue, "You have broken our glorious sleep; for this you must atone." And they assume unarmed fighting stances. Ocardo is having none of this and attacks. Claude hits one of the monks with a guiding bolt and Remy attacks with his rapier. Bobolink follows up with a spray of magic missiles. This takes down one of the fighters. In one fluid motion the female monk stuns Remy and Dioica with punches and Bobolink runs behind Ocardo. But the remaining fighter cannot land a punch on Ocardo. Poon Tang tries throwing holy water over the woman, but she is unaffected. Claude hits her with another guiding bolt and Ocardo cuts her down. You decide that these must be vampires, so you cut off their heads and burn their bodies.

The woman's wand is an ivory folding fan which you claim; also her bracelet which is made of platinum. The man's amulet is made of electrum and garnet. You also take the flask containing the silvery powder.

You continue north along a passage which then turns west. At the end a large block of stone obstructs the way. It doesn't seem to have been a part of the original construction, for its composition is more sandy than the stones that make up the walls of these ruins. Furthermore, a gap of several inches is visible along the sides of the block and between the stone and the ceiling. Moving the block requires your combined strength and doing so reveals a long passage south. You follow this and find a bronze door in the west wall right at the end. The door appears to be jammed. Checking your map, you suspect you can reach it by taking the west passage in the hall of statues. Claude volunteers to work his way around to try to open the door from the other side.

At the end of the west passage it turns north and ends at a massive bronze door. The door opens into a grand chamber. The place is filled with rubble and life-sized statuary, much of it broken. Standing in ranks is an army of clay statues, in what must have once been an impressive array. Now, half of them are fallen and crumbled. Near the door are spear-wielders, perhaps twenty of them, outfitted only in scraps of leather now. At their feet lay obsidian spearheads and bits of rotted wooden shafts. Behind these figures are archers, in a scattered formation. Few of them remain standing. Their arrows are gone, but they hold laminated bows, dried and worm-eaten.

Farther into the room are figures of warriors with war clubs and hand-axes, wearing scraps of lacquered leather, sandals, and caps. Beyond all of this in the north end of the chamber are a group of statues that must have been an honour guard. These warriors wear feathered robes and headdresses and are armed with pitted bronze spears. Each of these figures wears a breastplate of shells. They are standing near a domed structure. The stuccoed dome has no apparent openings.

On the east wall of the room are two carved stone columns flanking the remains of a covered sedan or litter, with statues of attendants standing nearby. Claude investigates the sedan. Inside the curtained portion is the skeletal remains of a human. Behind it is the bronze door which has been barred shut. Claude removes the bar to let the rest of you in. Inside, you decide to investigate the dome. It is weakly constructed and you manage to break into it easily. Inside you find 6 jade bead pectorals, a pendant made of silver and turquoise, and a bronze and chrysoprase lamp set into the stucco.

You pull the lamp free from the stucco which releases a wight from his tomb. He is wearing a similar silver and turquoise pendant. Working together, you make short work of this undead menace and recover his amulet.

As you backtrack to the hall of statues, you decide to check out a small passage to the south leading to an alcove. The alcove holds a three-foot-tall stone pedestal on which rests a small silver coffer. Fifteen feet in front of the alcove, there is a single small step up in the stone floor. Inside the alcove, the floor is elevated an additional two feet. Remy detects that this area is trapped and managed to disable it. Claude opens the coffer. Inside is a strange copper figurine, narrow, with fins, looking somewhat fish-like. Written on the side of this figurine are strange runes. On the slimmer end is a small arched square panel. The runes this time are in elvish and spell out the name *Ilnedraw*. Under the small panel is a wall of lighted, coloured beads. And when pressed, the figure rises into the air and leads you back and forth around the maze.

Eventually you manage to catch the statue and stuff it back in its coffer. You then try the east exit from the room containing the martial artists. This leads you through an L shaped passage to another room. A bitter stench assails the senses as you lay eyes on the room ahead. Inside, amid a pile of rubbish, offal, and bracken, ghostly lights move across the floor.

Closer observation reveals that the light is emitted by giant beetles. There seem to be around a dozen of these creatures in the room, each about three feet in length. They don't appear to take notice of you. From within the largest pile of trash, where most of the beetles are clustered, come glints of something shiny. You decide to wipe out the beetles and search the nest. You find three large turquoises and a rusty looking dagger which Ocardo takes.

You then head north again. The corridor ascends as you go north in a series of short, gently sloped staircases. When you are almost at the top, Remy fails to detect the presence of a pressure plate in the floor. A millstone is released and rolls down the steps. Remy, Claude, and Poon Tang are struck by the stone. It continues down the stairs and smashes the doors into the beetles nest.

You continue up into a spacious, vaulted hall, weathered and cracked from the ravages of time. The walls are charred and scored. Scattered around the floor are several stone statues of baboon-like creatures, chipped and tipped over. The remains of a few once-living baboons, partially eaten, lie nearby, with fungus covering their corpses. Ahead, something spherical floats in the air at about chest height. The sphere has a central eye and about a dozen tentacles growing out of its top. Each appendage has a white sphere with a black pupil at its tip. Without hesitation you blast the creature and it explodes in a cloud of gas. Fortunately, none of you are near enough to get caught in the blast. Near the centre of the south wall, you find a sack made of fish skin. It contains seven silver pellets the size of a sling bullet.

You continue to a bend in the passage ahead. As you approach the bend, you see a series of faint line drawings on the walls depicting people playing a game that uses a ball and has goals on either end of the playing field. At the corner there is a capstone which covers a hole in the floor. Two of you working together manage to lift the stone. Underneath are many skeletal remains. On top of them are several jade figures and a jade plaque, and a glistening black ball 1 foot in diameter.

![a ball hovering in the air in front of a goal](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/113/totyp-03-08.png "The ball")

As soon as you touch the ball, it suddenly flies into the air and hovers half way along the north passage. Both ahead of you and behind you are depressions in the wall that are limned in orange light. The ball tries to hit you or dodge around you to get to the north goal, while you attempt to send it back to the south goal. After several good strikes you manage to send it into the depression in the south wall. There is a sound of triumphant drums and the south goal goes dark. But the north goal continues to glow orange. Remy investigates and finds a pouch made of fish skin containing ten pink pearls, a topaz and shell necklace, and a whistle made of eagle's bone with a feather decoration. He blows the whistle and finds that he can fly so long as he continues to blow it.

Beyond the north goal in an oddly shaped room. The room is decorated in a cat motif. The center of the south-eastern wall is carved to resemble the face of a snarling tiger with hollow eyes. Near the center of the room is a stuffed tiger, posed as if on the prowl. The tiger's left ear has been torn off, leaving a jagged scar on the head. Also near the middle of the room stands a stone statue of a tiger-headed man holding a spear.

In several other spots on the floor are stuffed domestic cats in various poses: sitting, stalking, pouncing, and one is begging, pawing the air. One of these cats in the center of the room has been knocked over and chewed on; its stuffing is falling out.

Hung on the walls are several skins of lions and leopards, tiger heads, and a cat-of-nine- tails. Along the northwest edge of the chamber a large calendar stone is mounted on the wall above a stone table or altar.

The statue of the cat-man depicts a tall human male with two extra sets of nipples. He seems to be wearing a tiger-faced mask and is clad only in a loincloth. A jagged scar runs across the left side of his chest, above the heart, and his chest is sunken and bony. The spear is stone-hafted, but bears a silvery head.

![statue of a cat-man holding a spear](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/114/400/378/totyp-03-09.png "Cat-man statue")

The calendar, a great wheel of stone, is carved from limestone. In the center of the calendar is a symbol of the sun surrounded with various sigils depicting seasons of the year. The stone is ten feet across and is mounted five feet above the floor over a stone altar. On the altar rests a ceremonial dagger of flint and a jade statue of a cat. At the foot of the altar is a stuffed cat, posed as if begging or attempting to catch something in the air.
