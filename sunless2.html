	<h1>The Sunless Citadel: Part 2</h1>
	<p>In the relative safety of the kobold held territory, the party learn that the kobolds have recently claimed a part
		of the citadel from the goblins of the Durbuluk tribe. The kobolds believe that the citadel is rightfully theirs as
		it is dedicated to the worship of Ashardalon the dragon. Although, Remy and Ocardo note that the construction of the
		citadel is distinctively elvish. The kobolds hold the main hall and the surrounding rooms, the goblins hold the area
		to the north of them. The goblins and the kobolds frequently raid each others areas capturing prisoners and trading
		back and forth for ransom.</p>
	<p>The north-east is infested by rats so both the kobolds and the goblins tend to avoid that area. The previous
		adventuring party took the north-east route to find a back way to the goblin territory. The kobolds have not heard
		from them since. But the goblins that stole Calcryx also came from that direction and were lead by Balsag, a
		&lsquo;large hairy goblin&rsquo; with two giant rats under his command. Dioica suspects from Meepo&rsquo;s
		description, that Balsag is not a goblin, but something else; possibly a bear.</p>
	<p>Badger intimidates the kobolds&rsquo; current goblin prisoners and finds out that the lower levels of the citadel
		are held by Belak the druid and that it is Belak that gets the goblins to sell the magic fruit in Oakhurst. He then
		pays the kobold jailers the price of a goblin foot and claims it from one unfortunate goblin prisoner; eating it raw
		in front of them; much to the kobolds amusement.</p>
	<p>As the party realise that they will be resting for a while, Princess goes back up the ravine to see to the horses.
		She sings them a song, magically instructing them to return to Oakhurst with a note for Kerowyn the merchant to see
		to their stabling until the party return.</p>
	<p>The party rest and heal themselves before continuing on the trail of the captured dragon Calcryx. On entering the
		rat infested area of the citadel, the party are once again able to pick up the tracks of the previous adventuring
		party. They find a dried up fountain in the shape of a dragon with an inscription which when read aloud in draconic
		causes the fountain to produce one last glob of reddish liquid. The party collect the liquid in a container and,
		after some experimentation, discover it to be a potion of fire breath.</p>
	<p>Opposite the fountain is a door, cold to the touch, with an inscription that reads &lsquo;rebuke the dead, open the
		way&rsquo; in draconic. Remy investigates the door and finds that it is trapped. He blocks the trap but is unable to
		unlock the door. Bobalink however is able to crack the lock. Unfortunately, Remy&rsquo;s attempt to disable the trap
		was ineffective and a scything blade swings down. Bobalink survives, but not entirely unscathed.</p>
	<p>Inside is a sanctuary holding the dusty sarcophagi of five elven nobles dressed in ceremonial robes. At the far end
		of the room is an altar, with images of dragons carved into its black obsidian. A single candle burns brightly with a
		continual flame. Next to the candle are a small crystal whistle and flask. Ocardo leads the party into the room and
		takes the whistle to examine it. The moment he does so, the skeletons of the elven nobles emerge from their
		sarcophagi and attack. In the ensuing battle, Pom Pom retrieves the whistle for Princess to examine. The whistle is
		inscribed with the name Night Caller in Dwarfish. She remembers from her knowledge of fairy tales, that whistles like
		this were created by the duergar (the grey dwarves of the Underdark) to call and control the undead. She blows the
		whistle and is able to take control of one of the elven skeletons. She names him Tree Trunks and turns him against
		his fellow skeletons. The party manage to dispatch the remaining skeletons and find that the crystal flask contains a
		potion of fire resistance. Badger takes the candle of continual flame and puts it in his lantern.</p>
	<p>The party continue north and find an array of prison cells, each of which has become home to a giant rat. Although
		individually the rats are quite weak, they attack as a pack and gnaw some serious damage into Tree Trunks old bones.
		After the party has killed the rats, they take a short rest and patch themselves up. Princess sings a song of rest
		and manages to patch up Tree Trunks.</p>
	<p>The next chamber has two pit traps, one at its entrance and one at its exit to the west. The traps have already
		been disabled, presumably by the previous adventuring party. There is another fountain here with the inscription
		&lsquo;let there be death&rsquo; in draconic. Dioica once again reads aloud the inscription and prepares to collect
		another potion, however, this fountain belches out a cloud of poison gas. Fortunately, as a Dioica has a green dragon
		heritage, she has some resistance to poison and is only momentarily poisoned by the gas.</p>
	<p>The smell of rotting meat comes from the door to the west. Beyond it, the party find a giant and bloated rat which
		Meepo calls Guthash. She is apparently the mother to all the giant rats in the citadel. Badger is swarmed by a pack
		of giant rats and overwhelmed but Pom Pom grabs him and pulls him away from danger. Princess puts Guthash to sleep
		with a magical song and the party defeat the rest of rats with a combination of magic and weapons. Badger is revived
		and delivers a coup de grace on the sleeping Guthash, however, the bloated rat explodes covering Badger in diseased
		rat offal. Unfortunately, Badger contracts the disease from the rat. Dioica diagnoses the disease but it is currently
		beyond her ability to cure him. She expects that he will slowly waste away unless he receives some restorative magic.</p>

	<p>In among the filth of the rats&rsquo; nest they find several goblin and kobold corpses and one dead human. The
		human has a gold ring with the name Karakas engraved in it. Karakas was the name of the ranger in the adventuring
		party they are following. Among his belongings they find additional supplies and a potion of healing. There is no
		sign of what happened to the rest of the adventuring party.</p>
	<p>The party backtrack to a door they have yet to open and continue westward. The party continues cautiously. They
		slowly open the door to the next chamber and thereby avoid ringing the bell attached to the other side. The floor of
		the room is covered with caltrops, and at the end of the room is a low crenelated wall. The party carefully pick
		their way through the caltrops and avoid alerting the goblin archers camping beyond the wall. They are able to
		surprise and defeat the goblins without too much trouble.</p>
	<p>The next area however, is harder to navigate. It is an archery practice range with another crenelated wall at the
		end, and the goblins stationed here are already alerted due to the death cries of their fellows. Dioica transforms
		herself into a tiny spider and crawls unnoticed across the ceiling and behind the goblin archers. Once she is in
		place, Pom Pom runs in and is peppered with arrows. (Again, the party notice that Pom Pom appears immune to mundane
		weapon attacks.) The rest of the party charge the goblins, while Dioica returns to dragonborn form and breathes
		poison gas. Again the party cut down the goblins. However this time, one manages to escape into the hall to the
		north. It bangs on the door across the hall to raise the alarm, before begin skewered to the door by an arrow.</p>
	<p>The door opens and the room contains a group of goblin bandits. It&rsquo;s a tough battle in confined quarters, but
		the party manage to prevail. However Dioica is knocked unconscious during the fighting and the party decide to rest
		and recover their strength before attempting to go any further. Although, not before Remy falls headlong into another
		pit trap while checking the door at the end of the hall. He does however manage to find a long-lost gold ring with an
		inset sapphire for his trouble.</p>
