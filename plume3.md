# White Plume Mountain: Part 3

You wait for your things to cool while you collect amulets from the ghouls. In the ghouls' chamber you also find 7 pieces of jewellery from their previous victims. You move on, up some stairs into the next room.

It is a long and thin room running from east to west. The path to the west is broken by a sizeable gap, and you can see the glint of metal at the bottom of the opening. The floor beyond this area has a silvery sheen. In the distance you can see another hole, beyond which is a patch of floor that adjoins the western wall.

Suspicious of the silvery floor, Claude bathes it in sacred flame. It appears untouched by the magic as the flames reflect off. Badger ties a rope around his waist and jumps onto the surface, while the rest of the party hold the rope. He slides uncontrollably towards the opposite side and bounces back when he reaches the end of his tether. The party catch him as he rebounds across the pit.

Claude starts taking apart the door to the room while Remy ties two ropes together and tries his whistle. Flying magic has no effect in this room. It appears to be magically warded. Ocardo tries to teleport himself but this is also blocked. Frustrated, he raises a spectre and names it Phil.

Claude breaks the door into planks and channels _knowledge of the ages_ from his deity. He temporarily gains the skills of a carpenter and constructs a rudimentary bridge across the gaps.

You use the bridge to get safely to the other side of the room. There, is another door leading north. Remy listens carefully but can hear nothing on the other side. He checks for traps before attempting to open it. Ocardo detects illusion magic coming from the west wall. The entire west wall is an illusion and the real west wall lies ten feet further on. This illusion appears constructed to frustrate attempts to cross using the opposite wall.

You continue through the door along a passage running west, leading to a tee junction. The connecting passage runs north to south and both directions end in a door. Considering your options, you decide to go south. You open the door here into an enormous chamber defined by terraced steps that ring the entire area and descend toward a central enclosure.

![a large aquarium with descending rings of creatures](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/131/850/600/totyp-04-10.png "inverted ziggurat")

A few feet south of the door, water laps at the edge of the stone floor. Looking to the side, you can see that the ring of the terrace that lies beyond is a ten-foot-deep ring of water held in by a nearly transparent wall. Another of these watery steps in the terrace is somewhat lower than the first; at the level in between these aquariums, the terrace steps are dry, but the area is still enclosed by a glassy wall like the others.

Recognising this room as the inverted ziggurat described in the note, you decide to try the north end of the passage first.

Beyond this door, you find a large rectangular room. Water not only flows through this room, it floats. Entering a hole in the western wall, two feet off the floor, is a stream seemingly suspended in mid-air. It flows out of another hole near the northeast corner. The water is about three feet deep. You can see a few blind cave fish being carried along in the brisk current. On either side of the door are a total of six kayaks, each able to carry two riders, but there are no paddles to be found.

Badger uses _speak with animals_ to talk to the cave fish. They tell him that the stream runs in a large circle. Badger and Remy take one of the kayaks and try it out. They travel through a small tunnel in the wall and come out in another chamber. As they emerge, a net is cast over them. Remy's lightning reflexes and magic whistle allow him to avoid the net and carry Badger into the air. In the room are nine knights. They aim their crossbows at Remy and Badger. Remy uses the dust of disappearance to make himself and Badger invisible. They then fly back into the suspended water stream and are carried back around to the first room by the strong current.

You decide to take a rest and consider your plans. Claude traps the entrance of the water tunnel with a length of razor wire in case any of the knights decide to use the lost kayak to reach you. However, your rest is disturbed by a couple of animated stone gargoyles wandering up the corridor from the south.

You attack the gargoyles. The fight is short and Bobolink finally destroys them with a _lightning bolt_.

After a short rest you decide to have Bobolink create an illusion to distract the knights as you enter in the kayaks. Fortunately, Claude remembers to remove the trap wire before you begin your assault. Bobolink creates an illusion of a kayak in front of you as you enter and the first two knights waste their net on it.

The leader of the knights looks familiar. He is the notorious Sir Bluto Sans Pite. He was a respected Knight of the Realm before his indictment in the River of Blood mass-murder case. His mysterious disappearance from prison left even the Royal Magician-Detectives baffled, and a bounty of 10,000 gp was posted on him. You aim to collect that bounty.

You throw everything you have at Sir Bluto and his knights. Phil the spectre is taken down by two of them. Bobolink turns himself invisible but is caught in one of the nets. Claude hits Bluto with a guiding bolt, and Ocardo uses a _command_ to get one of the knights to undress, while Bobolink escapes the net and shanks Bluto.

Bluto moves in to cut down the gnome, but Bobolink casts _mirror image_ on himself and Bluto must first smash his way through the illusions. Bobolink is eventually struck by Bluto, but survives, and strikes back taking the notorious knight down and tea-bagging his corpse. You manage to defeat the remaining knights with Nine's help.

From Bluto you gain a magic key and _boots of striding and leaping_, and proof of his defeat. Searching the lair, you also find 3 objet d'art and a silver raven _figurine of wondrous power_. After your battle, you take a long rest to recover.

Once rested, you find that the key reveals and opens a secret door in this chamber. The secret passage beyond it leads back to the aquarium. You consider how to get down to the bottom safely. The top level is full or water and contains six giant crayfish that move towards you as you enter the room, expecting to be fed. The next level down contains six giant scorpions. Below that is another ring of water containing four sea lions. At the bottom, are three wing-clipped manticores. The manticores raise their tail spikes.

You decide to eliminate the manticores with ranged attacks first. You exchange fire with the beasts, but the crayfish grow impatient and decide to make you their meal. You fight off the crayfish while the tail spikes from the manticores below continue to assail you. A lightning bolt from Bobolink clears most of the crayfish and Ocardo teleports himself and Claude to the bottom to finish off the remaining manticore. Remy uses his magic whistle and flies down carrying Badger with him. Bobolink uses his magic boots to jump down. Poon Tang and Nine remain at the top and set up an escape rope with Badger.

At the bottom there is a safe in the north wall and a door in the south wall. Bobolink casts _knock_ on the safe. It opens, and contains 6,000 silver pieces and one very valuable looking piece of jewellery. You take the treasure and then open the door to the south.

It opens into a passage that tunnels south under the aquarium and ends in another door. You open this door into a large room. Lavish furnishings and decorations are everywhere in this large room. The floor is strewn with rugs and cushions, and tapestries cover the walls. A hookah as tall as an adult human stands in one corner. The largest piece of furniture is a sumptuous divan. The sole inhabitant of the room is a halfling that introduces himself as Qesnef. Using his magic detection, Ocardo senses magic of great power coming from under the divan. He searches while Bobolink fires up the hookah. Beneath the divan you find a greatsword, 1,000 pieces of electrum, 200 pieces of platinum, four pieces of jewellery, a potion, a scroll, and some plate armour.

![an ornate sword amid other items of treasure](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/132/300/377/totyp-04-11.png "Blackrazor")

The sword speaks telepathically to Ocardo and introduces itself as Blackrazor, the last of the three magic weapons that you have been sent to recover. Blackrazor offers Ocardo a pact in exchange for regularly feeding it the souls of his victims. As he does so, the room is suddenly engulfed in _darkness_.

You are hit by a _cone of cold_. The source of the magic seems to be the halfling. Claude dispels the darkness and then retreats, while Badger flies into a rage. However, the halfling has shape-shifted into an Oni. Badger lands some telling blows on the creature before it turns itself invisible. Ocardo engages the creature blindly while the rest of you withdraw to cover the exit. The Oni attempts to charm Ocardo, but fails. Claude takes it down with a _guiding bolt_. He then performs a prayer of healing on those that suffered cold damage.

On the Oni's corpse you find two magic rings. You take the treasure and climb out of the aquarium, avoiding the sea lions and giant scorpions. You retrace your steps back out towards the entrance to the mountain. But as you pass the gynosphinx guarding the entrance you hear a voice call to you out of the air.

"Not thinking of leaving, are you? You've been so very entertaining. I just couldn't think of letting you go, especially with those little items of mine. And since you've eliminated all of their guardians, why, you'll simply have to stay ... to take their places. I'll have to ask you to leave all of your ridiculous weapons behind and let Nix and Nox escort you to the Indoctrination Center. I'll be most disappointed if you cause me any trouble and Nix and Nox have to eliminate you. Don't worry -- you'll like it here."

Two efreet appear in a blast of elemental fire. One before you and one behind.

You refuse. In the ensuing battle, you are cut and burned by the genies. You eventually manage to defeat them, and Nine takes a lot of fire damage but resists going berserk. In their smoking remains you find 900 silver pieces, 400 gold pieces, and 60 platinum pieces.
