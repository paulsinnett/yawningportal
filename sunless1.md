An exotic band of adventurers take the road from Neverwinter to Oakhurst village: Ocardo Del'riverie, a half-elven sage and seeker of curios and ancient relics; Remy Martin, an elven noble with insatiable desires; Princess Giselle, a naive tiefling princess and Pom Pom, her infernal wolf companion; Badger, an impetuous halfling tribesman and his tribes' dragonborn druid Dioica; and Tubulanderous Bobalinkager the 4th, a gnomish urchin and master of illusions. They are drawn to the village by tales of magical fruit, mysterious disappearing saplings, and a reward for the return of a previous adventuring party.

The road is too long to travel completely within a day, so as the light fades, the party make camp near to the village of Oakhurst. During the night they are set upon by seven plant creatures surrounding their camp-site. The party defeat the creatures easily and Dioica detects that they were formed from a fruiting tree.

In the morning, they complete their journey to Oakhurst, secure lodgings, stabling, and replenish their supplies. There, they learn more from the proprietor of the village store, Kerowyn Hucrele, about the missing adventurers which included two of her children: Talgen and Sharwyn. They had delved into the Sunless Citadel many days ago and have not returned. Kerowyn offers the party 250 gold pieces for the safe return of each of her children, or should they have perished, 125 gold pieces for each of their signet rings.

They also learn the story of the magic fruit which goblins offer to the villagers twice a year at the summer and winter solstice. They have been doing this for the last twelve years. The summer solstice apple is ruby-red and provides life and vigour, but the winter solstice apple is albino and saps the life of those that eat it. The party also gather rumours of attacks on cattle and villagers locally that have left corpses covered in countless needle-like wounds. And they hear of Belak, a druid with a large pet frog, who asked about the Citadel some thirteen years ago. There are also legends of a dragon named Ashardalon, supposedly responsible for the Ashen Plain which skirts the Old Road.

The party travel the Old Road to the ravine into which the Citadel fell many years ago. There they find a knotted rope, recently tied to an overhanging pillar, that drops down to a ledge some 50 feet below. While the party tie up the horses and investigate the surroundings, Badger climbs down to the ledge. Too late, they find warnings about unusually large rodents. Alone on the ledge, Badger is set upon by giant rats. The party defeats the rats and Badger survives the ambush.

Once the rest of the party have descended to the ledge, they find a set of human tracks leading to a stairway. The stairway leads down into the darkness. At the bottom of the stairs, they find a crumbled courtyard, apparently the top of what was once a crenelated battlement, and leading to a door into a tower of the Sunless Citadel. Unfortunately, there is a pit trap in the floor in front of the tower. Remy falls in, and is attacked by a giant rat. He defeats the rat, and manages to find some gold and silver on the body of a dead goblin at the bottom. Once Bobalink has disabled the trap door mechanism, the party are able to enter the tower.

Inside are the remains of some goblins, killed in battle some time ago. The interior of the tower also has two other exits leading further into the citadel. The party take one exit which leads to a rubble filled passage and a large door, carved to look like a dragon. The door has a mechanical lock that even Bobalink cannot pick. Ocardo attempts to blast through it with magic, but he is unable to make a dent. Meanwhile, Badger manages to find another giant rat hiding in the rubble. And back in the tower, Giselle finds a loose brick and pushes it, opening a secret chamber. Unfortunately, the switch is trapped with a needle, but fortunately, any poison on the needle has long since evaporated.

Inside the secret chamber are the skeletal remains of a group of archers that may have once protected the citadel. Hoping that one of them might have a key to the dragon door, Ocardo enters the room. But as soon as he enters, the skeletons rise and attack. Thinking quickly, Dioica the druid, summons grasping weeds and vines from the ground to root the creatures in place. This allows the party to dispatch them without too much difficulty. In the battle, Pom Pom is struck with an arrow, but she is unconcerned. Unfortunately, the skeletons do not have a key, but they do each have a magic arrow.

Meanwhile, Bobalink investigates the other exit from the tower. He finds one empty room, one room containing a rusty iron keg with pipes leading into the ground, and a large chamber containing an empty cage and a tearful kobold dragon keeper by the name of Meepo. Meepo tells Bobalink that goblins have stolen their clan's dragon, Calcryx and that he can promise safe passage to see his leader, Yusdrayl.

When the rest of the party arrive they investigate the room and Meepo's story appears to check out. Badger doesn't trust the kobold and insists on putting a rope lead on him, but they agree to let Meepo lead them to Yusdrayl. True to his word, Meepo safely brings the party to the kobold leader Yusdrayl, revealing that the password for safe passage is the word 'Ticklecorn' in draconic. Yusdrayl offers the party the key to the dragon door in exchange for the safe return of her clan's dragon Calcryx.
