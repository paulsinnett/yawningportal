The party gather supplies for a trip to Blasingdell and an expedition into the mountains. When they arrive in Blasingdell, they talk with Baron Althon. He shows them the hilt of a weapon bearing Durgeddin's mark and tells them that it was found near a rocky hills known locally as the Stone Tooth. He offers the party 20 gold pieces for bringing back information, 100 gold pieces for any maps they can make.

Ocardo buys everyone a drink while Remy talks with Sarel, the proprietor of the Inn; an elf woman dressed almost as flamboyantly as himself. He learns that the local farmsteads are regularly pillaged by orc raiders of the Many Arrows tribe. The mayor, Sir Miles Berrick, offers the party a bounty of 25 gold pieces for any orcs, dead or alive.

The party set off into the mountains. It takes three days to find the mountain. They arrive at the foot of the hill and find a path leading up to a bare knob of rock which must be the Stone Tooth. Poon Tang finds some recent tracks on the path and suspect they belong to four booted humanoids. Possibly an orc raiding party. They can also see a faint plume of smoke rising high up the hill. They decide to get off the path and find their own way up the hill through the surrounding woods. It takes several hours of searching, but eventually Dioica manages to lead them to a small natural fissure through which the smoke is rising.

Bobolink turns himself invisible and investigates the area. He finds no traps or guards around the chimney. Dioica turns herself into a spider and climbs down into the hole while the rest of the party stand guard at the top. Below she finds a crudely constructed kitchen area with a small cooking fire and many pots and kettles stacked around. She has a wander through the connected maze of passages and finds a cell containing two human prisoners, a store of goods looted from the local farmsteads, a passage ending with a secret door, and a rope bridge guarded by two orcs. She decides to return to the surface to tell the others.

The party decide to put a rope down the hole and enter the caverns. They search for the secret passage first. The door opens into a shaman's lair, full of smoke, and the skulls and corpses of many creatures. The orc shaman is enraged and sends her two orc assistants to get the party out of her kitchen. Bobolink blinds the two assistants with a magical spray of colour and Remy shoots the shaman with an arrow. The shaman uses a command spell to send Ocardo fleeing from the room. Bobolink hides under a table and attacks the orcs from cover while Dioica uses her dragon breath on the orcs. The Shaman then creates a spiritual weapon and attacks the party with it. When Ocardo recovers from the command, he throws a blast of eldritch force at the orcs. An orc tries to remove Dioica's head with a great-axe but Remy takes it out with an arrow. And Poon Tang cuts the shaman's throat with her blades.

The party chops the right hands from the orcs as proof of their defeat. They also find some small flasks on the shaman. The fragile flasks contain alchemists fire. Bobolink opens a locked door at the other end of the kitchen and he and Ocardo investigate the room beyond. It is a hall with a staircase in the centre descending further into the dungeon. They are immediately attacked by small flying creatures from above.

Ocardo takes out two before they can strike, but one attaches itself to Bobolink and begins to drink his blood. Dioica takes on the remaining stirge, while Poon Tang kills the one on Bobolink. Remy skewers the last stirge with an arrow.

At the other end of the hall is a door, carved in the image of a glowering dwarf's face, surrounded by the skeletal remains of some orcs. The skeletons and weapons show signs of severe scorching. They guess that the door is trapped and manage to disable the mechanism. The trap sprays fire through small holes surrounding the door, but the copper drums feeding it are almost empty. Dioica collects what remains of the materials to craft some more of alchemists fire later.

There is an iron gate to the left of the door. The party break this open and find the area full of looted goods. Among the junk they find a strongbox containing 180 gold pieces and a small flask of clear and odourless liquid that the party are unable to identify.

They decide to explore the caves first before attempting to rescue the prisoners that Dioica spotted earlier. They make their way through the tunnels to a door some orc quarters. Remy enters to attack the orcs. These orcs are dirty fighters, and their pair up to attack their targets. One knocks Remy off his feet, while the other attempts to chop him up. Dioica conjures a flaming sphere among the orcs. Another pair of orcs attempt to double-team Ocardo, but get rebuked with fire. Bobolink casts a chromatic orb to further burn the orcs. Remy tries to get out of trouble while Dioica takes out an orc with her wolverine claws. Ocardo curses an orc and then blasts it with eldritch force, drawing healing from it as it dies.

Bobolink argues with the party over Ocardo's tactics. But they take the orc hands and also find 210 gold pieces, a topaz, and two onyx gems.

Along the same corridor, they find another door. This one has a human skull spiked into the centre. Bobolink casts his knock spell on the door and it opens to reveal a a small chamber covered in poorly cured animal hides and illuminated by smoking torches in bronze sconces. The smell is indescribable. A monstrous creature about ten feet in height steps forward, a massive axe in one hand. Two huge wolves strain at chains held closely in its other hand. "You think to challenge the Great Ulfe?" the creature booms.

"Ulfe? More like Poof-e!" says Bobolink.

"Vak! Thrag! At them!" roars the ogre as it charges, dropping the chains holding the wolves. Remy fires an arrow into the ogre, Ocardo blasts it with eldritch force, and Poon Tang lights it up with alchemist's fire. But it barely slows the ogre as it batters Bobolink unconscious. The wolves team up on Ocardo and take him down too. Dioica uses her magic to revive Ocardo while Remy uses his cunning action to get Bobolink back out into the corridor. With the battle taking place around the door, the ogre can't find a target so waits for his wolves to clear a way. The wolves continue to attack Ocardo and Poon Tang. And Ocardo is taken out of the fight a second time allowing the wolves through. The ogre brings his axe down on Poon Tang, but is surprised to find that it does no damage.

Dioica revives Bobolink and he casts mirror image on Poon Tang, making her harder to hit. The wolves begin to attack and destroy the mirror images. Remy hit the ogre with another arrow. Ocardo attacks the ogre with a his green flame. Bobolink uses burning hands. And finally, Dioica takes down the burning ogre with her spear. The wolves fight on, but the party manage to defeat them. They close and block the door and see to their wounds.

Inside Ulfe's chamber they find a chests containing 440 gold pieces, 1,600 silver pieces, a potion of climbing, and a magic rapier which Remy takes. They decide to take a short rest, free the prisoners, and then try to escape the stronghold over the rope bridge.

The exit is guarded by two orcs, but they have their backs to the bridge. Poon Tang and Dioica sneak across and try to take them down before they can raise any alarm. Poon Tang assassinates one with her blades. Dioica misses her attack, but Remy hits it with an arrow and Bobolink knocks it out with a magic missile. They cross the bridge with the prisoners. Take two more orc hands and then make a break for freedom.

Unfortunately, there are two more orc guards at the top of the path. Ocardo and Remy attack and defeat the orcs. But as they attempt to take two more orc hands, they find themselves fire upon by many arrows from arrow slits in the rocks above. They decide to run for safety.
