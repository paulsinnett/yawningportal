# White Plume Mountain: Part 1

You disembark the _Sinful Mermaid_ and say your farewells to Keyleth and her crew. On the docks you bump into Remy's mate Charlie. He says he's been waiting for you as three of his rich collector friends have recently had valuable magic items stolen from them and they want them returned. The items are the legendary weapons: _Wave_, a trident; _Whelm_, a warhammer; and, _Blackrazor_, a greatsword. He gives you a note, which the thief had sent to each of the collectors:

> _Search ye far or search ye near_  
> _You'll find no trace of the three_  
> _Unless you follow instructions clear_  
> _For the weapons abide with me._  
>  
> _North past forest, farm and furrow_  
> _You must go to the feathered mound_  
> _Then down away from the sun you'll burrow_  
> _Forget life, forget light, forget sound._  
>  
> _To rescue Wave, you must do battle_  
> _With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble_  
> _Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle_  
> _Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double._  
>  
> _Blackrazor yet remains to be won_  
> _Underneath inverted ziggurat._  
> _That garnered, think not that you're done_  
> _For now you'll find you are caught_  
>  
> _I care not, former owners brave_  
> _What heroes you seek to hire._  
> _Though mighty, I'll make each one my slave_  
> _Or send him to the fire._  

Charlie suspects the 'feathered mound' is _White Plume Mountain_ but he doesn't know what the rest of it refers to. This mountain is near mount Hotenow and the nearest village to it is Plumfall. The collectors have promised to grant anything you desire in return for their items if it is within their power to do so.

Each of the notes was signed with a distinctive symbol. Claude researches the symbol while the rest of you trade your treasures for magic items. A few weeks later you rendezvous to learn what Claude has discovered.

The symbol on the notes is that of the once feared wizard called Keraptis. This wizard disappeared hundreds of years ago. You think it unlikely that this is Keraptis himself, but rather someone using the wizard's historical reputation to intimidate. You use the _mirror of the past_ on the note and see images of an old man cackling away to himself. You suspect you may be walking into a trap.

You travel to Plumfall. There you find directions to the mountain about 5 miles away. You also learn of Dead Gnoll's Eye Socket, a small natural cave a couple of miles from the mountain. This cave is the only real shelter near the mountain where you can leave your horses and provisions.

White Plume Mountain is an almost perfectly conical volcanic hill. It is about 1,000 yards in diameter at its base and rises 800 feet above the surrounding land. A continuous geyser spouts from the summit a further 300 feet into the air and trails away to the east, giving the mountain its name. The spray from the geyser collects in depressions down the slope and merges into a sizeable stream. Steam vents are visible at various spots on the slopes but none are large enough for you to enter.

You find a cave entrance on the southern slope. It seems to breathe, exhaling a large cloud of steam and the slowly inhaling, like a person breathing on a cold day. Each cycle takes about 30 seconds. The cave is 8 feet in diameter and 40 feet long. At the end of the cave, near the roof, is a long, horizontal crevice about a foot wide. The air is sucked into this crack at great speed, creating the loud whistling noise and snuffing out any torches. Shortly the rush of air slows down, stops for a couple of seconds, and then comes back out in a great blast of hot mist. This mist is not hot enough to scald but it does make the cave very uncomfortable.

At the back of the cave, hidden under several inches of fine muck, you find a trap door with an iron ring set into it. Badger uses the strength of his magic belt to open the door. Directly beneath the door is a twenty foot square vertical shaft and the top of a spiral staircase.

The staircase is badly rusted but appears to be sturdy. The air inside the passageway is warm, humid, and rather foul. You reach the bottom of the stairs with a splash - the floor is submerged beneath a foot of water!

A passageway leads east from the stairs for 70 feet and then turns sharply north. Forty feet north the passage splits three ways: northwest, north, and northeast. At the junction sits a rather mangy and bedraggled looking creature.

As you approach, the creature speaks and asks you a riddle:

> _Round she is, yet flat as a board_  
> _Altar of the Lupine Lords_  
> _Jewel on black velvet, pearl in the sea_  
> _Unchanged but e'erchanging, eternally_  

Badger guesses 'moon' and the creature allows you to pass. You decide to take the middle path leading north. It runs for 60 feet but there is a deep pool in a small circular alcove in the east wall. At the bottom of this pool, you find a value, and you are able to turn it. You notice that the water level in the tunnels is slowly dropping.

You continue north. Ahead is what appears to be a water-covered room, with steps rising out of the muck on the far side. You find some strangely beguiling creatures in the water. They appear humanoid at first, and Badger finds himself irresistibly drawn to them. But as they approach you can see their shape shifting into monstrous lumps of seaweed. They attempt to grapple and drag Ocardo beneath the water. And Remy has to stop Badger from walking willingly into the water. Poon Tang attacks with the plant slaying sword while the rest of you attack with bows and swords. Fortunately, you manage to kill the creatures without anyone drowning.

Ocardo detects magic below the surface. He dives into the water. It is deceptively deep. In a chamber some 15 feet below the surface he finds the creature's treasure. He surfaces with:

- 600 gold pieces
- a diamond necklace
- and a suit of magic chain mail armour

The steps on the north side of the room lead into a passage going north for 30 feet and ending in a door. There is also a door in the east wall of the passage at the top of the steps. You decide to go through this nearer door.

This door opens into a stone corridor running east. However, after 30 feet, the stone corridor changes abruptly to a spinning cylinder, apparently made of some light-coloured metal. The inner surface rotates rapidly. It is painted in a dizzying black-and-white spiral pattern, and it glistens as if coated with some substance. The cylinder continues for another 30 feet and then continues into a short corridor with a door in the north wall at the end of the passage.

Ocardo takes a _misty step_ through the spinning cylinder and surprises a male human guard. The guard is hiding behind the door with a flaming arrow waiting to set fire to the oil covered cylinder. Instead he draws his longsword and calls for help to someone named "Snarla." Badger and Remy manage to bypass the cylinder without much trouble, but Poon Tang tumbles through. You engage the guard and Snarla, a female wizard in combat.

Snarla casts _mirror image_ so there appears to be four of her. The guard is a veteran fighter so he is hard to hit. Eventually you defeat him and destroy the wizard's mirror images. As the fighter dies, Snarla is enraged and turns into a werewolf. But with your combined attacks you manage to defeat her too.

Their room has a couple of benches and a table, on which are a large candlestick and a large book of magic. Unfortunately, the book is trapped, and as you open it, it explodes catching Ocardo and Badger with the full force of the blast. There is another room to the north of this one.

Unlike the room you just left, this place is beautifully decorated. The floor is covered by fine rugs, the walls by erotic tapestries and shimmering curtains, the ceiling by an intricate mosaic depicting a summer sky dotted with fleecy clouds. In the northeast corner is a large and lavishly covered bed, strewn with cushions. Next to it on a low table is a buffet of sweetmeats, cakes, and other delicious-looking comestibles. In the northwest corner of the room is a brass-bound oak chest.

You detect magic protecting the chest. Claude casts _dispel magic_ on it. Inside are:

- 400 electrum pieces
- 300 gold pieces
- 7 gems
