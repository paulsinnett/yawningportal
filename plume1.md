# White Plume Mountain: Part 1

You disembark the _Sinful Mermaid_ and say your farewells to Keyleth and her crew. On the docks you are met by Remy's mate Charlie. He says he's been waiting for you as three of his rich collector friends have recently had valuable magic items stolen from them. The legendary weapons are: Wave, a trident; Whelm, a warhammer; and, Blackrazor, a greatsword. He gives you a note, which the thief had sent to each of them:

	Search ye far or search ye near
	You’ll find no trace of the three
	Unless you follow instructions clear
	For the weapons abide with me.

	North past forest, farm and furrow
	You must go to the feathered mound
	Then down away from the sun you’ll burrow
	Forget life, forget light, forget sound.

	To rescue Wave, you must do battle
	With the Beast in the Boiling Bubble
	Crost cavern vast, where chain-links rattle
	Lies Whelm, past water-spouts double.

	Blackrazor yet remains to be won
	Underneath inverted ziggurat.
	That garnered, think not that you’re done
	For now you’ll find you are caught

	I care not, former owners brave
	What heroes you seek to hire.
	Though mighty, I’ll make each one my slave
	Or send him to the fire.

Charlie suspects the 'feathered mound' is _White Plume Mountain_ but he doesn't know what the rest of it refers to. This mountain is near mount Hotenow and the nearest village to it is Plumfall. Each of the notes was signed with a distinctive symbol. Claude decides to research the symbol while the rest of you sell off the treasures from the temple and buy yourselves improved equipment. A few weeks later you gather to learn what Claude has discovered.

The symbol on the notes is a that of an infamous wizard who lived hundreds of years ago. You think it unlikely that this is the same wizard. You suspect somebody is using the wizard reputation in an attempt to intimidate the victims into abandoning their treasures.

You travel to Plumfall. There you are able to find directions to the mountain and also to Dead Gnoll's Eye Socket, which is a nearby natural cave and somewhere safe that you can leave your horses and provisions.

It doeasn't take

The staircase is badly rusted but appears to be sturdy. The air inside the passageway is warm, humid, and rather foul. You reach the bottom of the stairs with a splash - the floor is submerged beneath a foot of water!

	Round she is, yet flat as a board
	Altar of the Lupine Lords
	Jewel on black velvet, pearl in the sea
	Unchanged but e’erchanging, eternally
