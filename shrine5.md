# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Epilogue

You return to Port Nyanzaru. It appears that rumour of your arrival precedes you. Many in the town avoid eye contact and keep their distance. You here people muttering about "the curse." Claude goes off to find a library to research some of the artifacts that you found.

You find an inn at the port frequented by the sailors known as _The Rusty Cutlass_. There, you find many sailors of all nations and races. There are many humans from various nations as well as dragonborn, halfings, elves, dwarves, and even goblins. One noble looking elf woman, dressed in fine clothes, is playing a drink game with a table of sailors. Remy decides to introduce himself. Ocardo goes to the bar and tries to find a captain willing to take you back to the mainland.

As Remy approaches the elf woman she looks up. She is rather drunk. "Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. If it isn't Remy Martin." Remy frantically searches his memory and does find her face familiar, but he can't quite place it. She introduces herself as Keyleth. Apparently Remy had taken her on a tour of the islands during one of his many gap years and then promptly forgotten about her when something else had taken his interest. Although has only a vague recollection of the event, it still seems something of a sore point for Keyleth. She tries to slap him, but she's too drunk. Remy turn on the charm and manages to placate her.

Ocardo meets with Shanairla, the first mate of the _Sinful Mermaid_, his deception skills are a bit rusty, so he decides to level with her.
