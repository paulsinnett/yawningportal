# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Epilogue

You return to Port Nyanzaru. It appears that rumour of your arrival precedes you. Many in the town avoid eye contact and keep their distance. You here people muttering about "the curse." Claude goes off to find a library to research some of the artifacts that you found.

You find an inn at the port frequented by the sailors known as _The Rusty Cutlass_. There, you find many sailors of all nations and races. There are many humans from various nations as well as dragonborn, halfings, elves, dwarves, and even goblins. One noble looking elf woman, dressed in fine clothes, is playing a drink game with a table of sailors. Remy decides to introduce himself. Ocardo goes to the bar and tries to find a captain willing to take you back to the mainland.

As Remy approaches the elf woman she looks up. She is rather drunk. "Well, well, well, look what the cat dragged in. If it isn't Remy Martin." Remy frantically searches his memory and does find her face familiar, but he can't quite place it. She introduces herself as Keyleth. Apparently Remy had taken her on a tour of the islands during one of his many gap years and then promptly forgotten about her when something else had taken his interest. Although has only a vague recollection of the event, it still seems something of a sore point for Keyleth. She tries to slap him, but she's too drunk. Remy turn on the charm and manages to placate her.

Ocardo meets with Shanairla, the first mate of the _Sinful Mermaid_, his deception skills are a bit rusty, so he decides to level with her.

Keyleth takes you on a tour of her ship. It has three decks with the ship's hold being the lowest deck. You decide to stash your treasure in the hold and take it in turns to watch. Poon Tang takes the first watch in the hold, while Badger keeps a lookout on the main deck and the rest of you rest in the cabins.

During Badger's watch, he is approached by a charming and well dressed gentleman. He is not a member of the crew or another passenger but convinces Badger to invite him below deck to speak with the rest of you. Ocardo and Remy are playing cards with some of the crew as Badger introduces his guest. The man calls himself Ivan Bratomil and says that he is an emissary of Zotlizaha the vampire god and has come to reclaim his treasure.

He turns his charm on Ocardo who also thinks this to be a most reasonable request. Remy attacks the vampire and the sailors all grab weapons, while Badger and Ocardo attempt to prevent anyone from attacking the vampire. The vampire calls for more aid. Down in the hold, rats begin to emerge from the shadows swarm up to the lower deck. Poon Tang is mobbed by dozens of the tiny creatures. In an attempt to calm the situation Ocardo casts darkness preventing anyone but himself from seeing what is going on.

Hearing the noise, Claude and Dioica come out of their cabins. Dioica attempts to make for the stairs while Claude casts a guiding bolt to prevent the vampire from regenerating. As you attack, vampire continues to flit from person to person with unnatural speed.
