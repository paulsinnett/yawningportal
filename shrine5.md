# The Hidden Shrine of Tamoachan: Epilogue

You return to Port Nyanzaru. Rumour of your arrival and your haul precedes you. Many in the town avoid eye contact, mutter about 'the curse,' and keep their distance. Claude looks for a library to research the artefacts you found.

You find an inn near the docks called _The Rusty Cutlass_. There, you find sailors of all nations and races. Most are human, but there are dragonborn, halflings, elves, and even goblins represented. One noble looking elf woman, dressed in fine clothes, is playing a drinking game with a table of sailors. Remy immediately decides to introduce himself while Ocardo goes to the bar to look for a captain willing to take you and your cargo back to the mainland.

As Remy approaches the elf woman, she looks up. She is quite drunk. "Well, well, well, if it isn't Remy Martin." Remy frantically searches his memory. He finds her face familiar, but he can't quite place it. Indignantly, she introduces herself as Keyleth. Apparently Remy had taken her on a tour of the The Moonshaes during one of his, many, gap years and then promptly forgotten about her when something else had caught his attention. Although he has only a vague recollection of the trip, it still seems something of a sore point for Keyleth. She tries to slap him, but she is too drunk. Remy turn on the charm and manages to placate her.

Ocardo meets with Shanairla, another elf, and the first mate of the _Sinful Mermaid_. His deception skills are a bit rusty and she instantly sees through his attempts to hide the nature of your cargo. He decides to trust her and arranges to negotiate a price for passage to Neverwinter with her captain in the morning.

You arrange to stay at the inn. Remy and Keyleth get themselves a room, while the rest of you share a dormitory and take turns guarding your treasure. Poon Tang uses her stone shaping amulet to seal the treasure within the walls of the room. Claude returns with concerning news. The vampire shrine that you found wasn't to a mere vampire, but to a vampire god known as Zotzilaha. The jade placard that you found bears an image of this god.

While you rest, Claude magically mends the mace and you mix your dried potions with wine to give them full potency. Claude also prepares himself against vampire attack as best as he can. However, the night passes without incident.

In the morning, Remy wakes to find Keyleth has gone. You release your treasure and go to meet the captain of the _Sinful Mermaid_ on the dock. The crew are busy preparing the ship. The officers are lined up beside the gangplank. Keyleth herself is the captain. You negotiate a fee of 300 gold pieces for the journey.

Keyleth takes you on a tour the ship. It has three decks with the ship's hold being the lowest. You decide to stash your treasure in the hold and take it in turns to watch. Poon Tang takes the first watch in the hold, while Badger keeps a lookout on the main deck, and the rest of you retire to your cabins. Ocardo contacts Terry and is tasked with recovering the legendary sentient sword: _Blackrazor_.

During Badger's watch, he is approached by a charming and well dressed gentleman. He is not a member of the crew or another passenger but convinces Badger to invite him below deck to speak with the rest of you. Ocardo and Remy are playing cards with some of the crew as Badger approaches with his new friend. The man introduces himself as Ivan Bratomil and says, "I am an emissary of the great Zotzilaha, and I come to reclaim his treasure." He turns his charm on Ocardo who thinks this a most reasonable request.

Remy plays along to get in close, makes a sneak attack, and then ducks into hiding. The man laughs off the attack as the wound closes before your eyes and he calls for the 'children of the night' to come to his aid. The crew grab weapons while Ocardo and Badger attempt to calm everyone down and prevent them from attacking their new friend. In the hold, Poon Tang becomes aware of swarms of rats emerging from hiding within the ship's hold. She is surrounded while many more make their way up to the lower deck. Hearing the noise, Claude comes out of his cabin and immediately attempts to turn the vampire. Unfortunately his faith is not strong enough.

As the battle joins, Remy dives in and out of cover, attempting to strike the vampire, while Badger tries to prevent him. One of the crew manages to stab the vampire with a dagger, but the vampire grabs him and moves in for a bite. Ocardo attempts to grapple another member of the crew to prevent him from attacking but he is unable to stop them. Claude hits the vampire with a guiding bolt, its radiant light temporarily preventing the creature's supernatural healing. You call for Dioica to get the captain.

Badger attempts to grapple Claude to stop him from inflicting any more damage on his friend while Ocardo casts darkness to protect him. Rats swarm up from the hold, as Dioica emerges from her cabin and makes for the stairs. She is attacked, and one of the crew is overwhelmed and bitten to death. Claude casts confusion on the rats allowing Dioica to get through and call for the captain.

Badger finally gets a hold of Claude, and Ocardo surrounds the remaining crew in magical darkness, hindering any further attacks. The vampire grapples Remy but fails to bite him. Remy pours holy water over the vampire, which burns him and temporarily prevents him from healing. The remaining crew find their way out of the magical darkness and try to help Remy but the vampire sinks his teeth in and drinks his blood. You see the vampire's wounds heal as he feeds.

As turning didn't work, Claude attempts _banishment_, but the vampire resists that magic too. Remy continues to struggle for freedom, the crew continue to attack the rats, and Badger continues to grapple with Claude. In the hold, Poon Tang is slowly winning her battle with the rats.

Claude casts _calm emotions_ on Ocardo and Badger. They snap out of their trance and join in the battle against the vampire and his rat army. Fresh crewmen descend the stairs to the lower deck in answer to Dioica's calls for help. The rats continue to attack, and the vampire flits around the deck with supernatural speed. Eventually it gets ahold of Ocardo and drinks his blood. In return he receives a _hellish rebuke_. Poon Tang emerges from the hold and shoots the vampire with her bow. Remy skewers him on his rapier. And Badger hacks him up with his swords. The vampire turns to mist and Dioica blasts it with a lightning bolt. The remaining rats scatter back into the hold.

You are exhausted by your encounter. You thank the crew for their assistance and bury the dead crewman at sea in the morning. The rest of the journey is uneventful and you arrive back at the docks in Neverwinter a few days later.
