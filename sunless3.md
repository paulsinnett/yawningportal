# The Sunless Citadel: Part 3

Claude, a friend of Ocardo's, and a fellow seeker of ancient relics, plans to join the party in Neverwinter and seek the Sunless Citadel with them. But a last minute errand for his priesthood leaves him unable to make the rendezvous, so he follows their trail through Oakhurst, to the ravine, and on through the ruins of the citadel, until he finds the kobold lair. The kobolds are still too focussed on their skirmishes with the goblins to pay much attention to this lone human and Yusdrayl, the kobold leader directs him along the path his party has taken. And so, he finds them recuperating from their battles with the goblins, and in desperate need of his healing magic.

With the party suitably patched up, they explore their current surroundings further. A key found on one of the goblin corpses opens one locked door. Squalor reigns in this low-ceilinged room. A large iron spike is driven into the floor near the door, and a small iron cage is set farther back. Several sets of corroded manacles are connected to the walls,and some still bind a few crumbling skeletons. Inside, locked in a cage not much bigger than himself, they found a gnome acolyte of Pelor in a sorry state. Bobolink knows this gnome as Erky Timbers, a childhood friend. He tries over-enthusiastically to free his friend but only manages to jam the lock shut. Fortunately, Princess is able to mend the lock with a song of mending, allowing Remy to open it and free the poor gnome.

Erky tells the party that he was captured by goblin bandits on the road to Oakhurst and imprisoned many days ago along with three other prisoners: Talgen, Sharwyn, and Sir Bradford. They had remained as fellow prisoners of the goblins for some days before Belak had called for them. He doesn't know what happened to them after that. As an acolyte of Pelor, Erky has some healing magic of his own and he offers to aid the party on there current quest if he can. While the gnomes caper around celebrating Erky's release from the goblin prison, the rest of the party continue to explore.

They find an unoccupied store room containing various goblin supplies. The party claim 5 pints of oil and Badger claims 5 small barrels labelled 'elf pudding' in goblin scrawl. Remy and Ocardo shudder to think of the ingredients that would go into such a pudding but Badger is unperturbed.

They then move on to the door at the end of the corridor beyond the pit trap that Remy had previously fallen into. They pick the lock and carefully open the door. Inside, mounted and stuffed animal heads adorn the walls. The mounting job is sloppy, and the assortment of heads includes cattle, rats, and other not particularly impressive specimens. A few grisly trophies share the wall with the animals, including a couple of kobold heads. Smashed and broken cabinets and small tables litter the periphery of the room, mute victims of some sort of rampage. A rusted iron spike stands in the centre of the room, trailing a broken chain. Thin patches of frost coat sections of the walls, floor, and debris. As if smelling his dragon, Meepo rushes into the room and cries out, "Calcryx!"

On hearing the voice of her former jailer, the white dragon wyrmling jumps onto the edge of an overturned table from her makeshift nest. She takes a deep breath, ready to spray the kobold with her frosty breath.

But before Calcryx can turn the kobold into an ice sculpture, Princess dashes into the room and bundles herself and Meepo behind some smashed cabinets. Meanwhile Dioica strides confidently into the room and addresses the dragon in her own language. Calcryx, never having met a dragonborn before, is impressed enough to hear her out. Dioica negotiates a deal with Calcryx in which the dragon can have her revenge on the goblins and also return to take control of the kobold colony. And Ocardo wagers 10 gold pieces with Calcryx that he can kill more goblins.

Calcryx had begun to gather a small treasure hoard for herself. Although there is little of value, the party do find a scroll case carved of bone and carrying the inscription "Khundrukar" in the Dwarvish alphabet. Inside, is an old parchment, aged and water damaged, but containing the following short message in Dwarvish, "... the remaining few. By order of Durgeddin the Black, we have created a secret dwarven redoubt. None shall find us; however, ..." Although nobody recognises any of the names or information, Remy thinks it could fetch a good price in a dwarven community.

A second door in the trophy room leads into a hall. Several torches mounted in crude sconces burn fitfully around this chamber, filling the air with a haze. A double row of marble columns carved with entwining dragons runs the length of the hall. And through the door at the end of the hall can be heard the voices of dozens of goblins. The party burst through to launch a surprise attack on goblin-ville. What might once have been a cathedral is now a goblin lair, thick with the filth of years of goblin life. Scores of wall- and floor-mounted sconces filled with violet-glowing fungi provide illumination. Dozens of goblins go about their daily business, which involves a lot of rudeness and violence. Along the southern wall is a heaping pile of assorted items, including wagon wheels, broken armour and rusted arms, chests, small statues, antique furniture, and artwork. But although the room is full of goblins, few are capable of combat.

Bobolink creates an illusion of the dragon in the opposite doorway, giving the party a much needed distraction and making the goblins think they have been flanked by dragons. Calcryx then pushes into the room and catches a full half of the weapon carrying goblins with a single blast of her freezing breath. The goblin women and children flee to the only apparently safe exit in the northwest. Meanwhile Badger stays at the back to guard the doors in the south of the hall.

In the ensuing battle the party kill many common goblins, guards, and bandits. Calcryx freezes the other half of the common goblins. Badger manages to hold a whole raiding party of goblin bandits in their lair. Calcryx makes a meal of a common goblin. Then Durnn, the hobgoblin leader, bursts into the room leading his troop of hobgoblin warriors and the goblin's shaman. Princess manages to put two of the hobgoblins and the goblin shaman to sleep. The remaining hobgoblins, including Durnn attack the party. These creatures are much harder to hit than the goblins. Pom-Pom's protection against non-magical weapons is discovered by the hobgoblins although they are unable to do much about it. Dioica is hit several times while attempting to capture a goblin bandit alive. Remy is forced to retreat where he helps Badger to defeat the goblin bandits by shooting an arrow right through one goblin and into another. At last Princess puts the remaining hobgoblins to sleep and the remaining goblins flee down the shaft in the hobgoblin's room to the northeast.

On Durnn they find splint armour bearing the Hucrele family crest, Talgen's gold signet ring, and a small key. Some of the hobgoblins are wearing valuable jewellery. On the shaman they find a scroll of faerie fire and a scroll of expeditious retreat. In Durnn's room: a circular shaft pierces the floor of the forty-foot-diameter domed chamber. Dim violet light shines out of the shaft, revealing sickly white and grey vines that coat the walls of the shaft. The light is supplemented by four lit wall torches set equidistant around the periphery of the chamber. A crudely fashioned stone throne sits against the curve of the northwestern wall. A large iron chest serves as the throne's footstool. A sapling grows in a wide stone pot next to the throne. Durnn's key opens the chest which contains 231 gold pieces and two onyx gems. Also in Durnn's room they find a potion of healing, two vials of antitoxin, and a ruby red apple.

Princess and Badger both rush for the apple. Princess gets to it first and contemplates eating it but the rest of the party manage to convince her to give it to badger given its rumoured ability to cure any disease. Badger scoffs the apple and is instantly healed of his infection. The party patch themselves up and rest while keeping watch over the shaft. As they rest, Ocardo contacts his otherwoldly patron and is gifted a magical blade. Claude then contacts spirits to augur a way forward. He asks them about the dragon door and they tell him that he will find both weal and woe.

Calcryx wants to return to the kobold colony and the party honour their bargain and help her to take control. The kobolds don't resist as they would have happened sooner or later. And so the party gain the key to the dragon door, along with a small feather token, spell scrolls of mage armour, spider climb, and knock, and a flask containing three doses of an elixir. Claude identifies the token as Quaal's swan boat feather token, and the elixir is an elixir of health.

The party return to the dragon door and use the key to open it. As the door opens, a hissing noise and a puff of dust around the door indicate that the chamber beyond has been sealed for ages. Dust, long undisturbed, covers every surface in this large gallery. The air here is stale. Three alcoves are on the north wall, and one is on the south wall. Each alcove contains a dust-covered stone pedestal with a fist-sized crystalline globe resting on it. The globes in the northern alcoves are cracked and dark, but the globe in the southern alcove glows with a soft blue light. Faint tinkling notes issue from it. The music causes several of the party to flee the ruins and run back out to the base of the ravine. Ocardo however is unaffected by its magic and manages to smash it.

The way ahead is a twenty foot long corridor. Remy notices that the floor in the centre is a mechanical pressure plate. He manages to disable it with an iron spike allowing entry to the hall beyond. Dust fills this hall like a layer of grey snow. In the rounded northern end of the chamber stands a ten-foot-tall sculpture of a coiled dragon carved from red-veined white marble. When they approach the statue it speaks:

> ![a picture of a marble statue of a dragon](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/78/totyp-01-03.png "the dragon statue")
> "We come at night without being fetched;
> we disappear by day without being stolen.
> What are we?"

The party quickly figure out the answer, "stars," and a secret door opens in the western wall. Dust cloaks the contents of this twenty-foot-wide hall. Six alcoves line the walls, three to the north and three to the south. Each alcove except the southwest one holds a humanoid figure carved of red-veined white marble. The figures resemble tall elves in plate armour. A stone archway at the west end of the hall opens into a wide room from which greenish light glows. A dark pit is situated before the archway. The pit contains spikes. It would not be too far to jump, but the party construct a bridge across from broken slabs leading them into the room beyond.

Violet marble tiles cover the floor and walls, though all are cracked or broken, revealing rough-hewn stone beneath. Sconces are attached to the walls at each corner. One holds a torch that burns with greenish fire. A marble sarcophagus, easily nine feet long, lies in the room's centre. The coffin is carved with dragon imagery, and the head of the sarcophagus resembles a dragon's head. Rusting iron clasps firmly lock down the lid. With some effort the party manage to open the latches and between them lift off the lid. Inside is a luminous, wispy form, dressed in rotted finery, but its jewellery and rings adorned with tiny silver dragons still sparkle.

The party manage to do some damage to the creature before it lets out a mournful wail. On hearing this hideous wail, the party all take psychic damage, except Tree Trunks, who is unaffected. Bobolink, Dioica, and Pom Pom fall unconscious. When Pom-Pom falls unconscious, she reverts to her true form: a tiefling. Ocardo strikes with his new dark weapon and manages to fell the creature and drain its life force to help heal his own wounds, while Erky revives Bobolink.

As the creature evaporates, a small bat-like creatures flies out of a secret alcove shouting "I'm free!" Claude attempts to call out the creature in Abyssal, but it continues to flee. Remy shoots it with an arrow, and Bobolink takes it down with a magic missile. Claude examines the creatures which has reverted to its true form, a tiny green demon.

![a picture of a tiny green demon](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/271/1000/1000/636252769318699115.jpeg "the green demon")

The unconscious party members are revived and the sarcophagus searched. Inside is a ceremonial dagger, two silver rings, a silver amulet, 220 silver pieces, 50 gold pieces, and four spell scrolls: command, cure wounds, inflict wounds, and guiding bolt. Claude's spirits were correct: the party found both weal and woe. The naked tiefling that was Pom-Pom has some explaining to do.
