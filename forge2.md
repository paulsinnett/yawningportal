# The Forge of Fury: Part 2

When you are well out of bow range you stop to catch your breath. The captives you have rescued are named Geradil and Courana. They hail from a small settlement a few miles from Blasingdell. You escort them back to their farmstead to the relief of their neighbours. You are provided with a modest feast and a chance to clean yourselves up, before heading back to Blasingdell with your collection of orc hands.

Back in Blasingdell you meet up with Claude and Badger. Claude has spent some time researching the legend of Durgeddin and his fortress while Badger has been occupied with tribal business. Bobolink is eager to trade in the orc hands for the bounty and get his share of the proceeds back to his orphanage. Unfortunately you have just missed a trader taking goods south. Since the rest of you are eager to get back to the fortress and secure your find before word gets out, you agree to split up. Bobolink and Poon Tang will travel south and attempt to catch the trader and meet the rest of you back at the Stone Tooth as soon as they can. Meanwhile you will attempt to clear out any remaining orcs.

Your journey back to Stone Tooth is uneventful. However as you approach the mountain you find fresh orc tracks leading away. Suspecting a trap, you attempt to find again the secret chimney, but without any smoke to guide you, you are unable to relocate it. Instead you approach the mountain door from the front. Remy sneaks ahead and checks for traps but it seems that the orcs have abandoned the area.

You decide to make sure the orcs aren't waiting to spring a trap and attempt to find the secret entrance to the archer stations above either side of the entrance. Ocardo and Badger search the area while Dioica transforms herself into a spider and climbs up and through the arrow slits. She finds that the orcs have abandoned the fortress. Ocardo and Badger are unable to discover the mechanisms that open the entrances to the archer stations although they know where they must be. Instead you continue further into the lair.

You make your way back to Ulfe's room and the as yet unexplored dwarf statue. It is a fierce-looking dwarf in heavy mail armour. The stone warrior holds a sword in one hand and a smith's hammer in the other. It is about seven feet tall and stands on a large stone pedestal. As Ocardo and Badger approach, they feel a small click from the floor beneath. The statue's bearded face slides open, like an oversized nutcracker, and greenish gas billows forth. Fortunately the poison has no effect on Ocardo or Badger.

Examining the area, you find a secret door leading to a chamber filled with rough-hewn bunks, tables, and chairs. And you rejoin with Dioica who has transformed back into her dragonborn form and entered the chamber from the other side. The floor is strewn with filthy pelts. A dozen or so humanoids have recently used this area as a sleeping quarters. Claude determines that it is unusual for orcs to be so organised and suspects that the Great Ulfe may have been a figurehead and their real leader was some other more intelligent creature.

Considering this floor to be clear, you decide to return to the grand stairs to the east of the caves. Dozens of stone steps lead down into darkness. Ocardo casts a light spell on a lantern so you can all see where you are going. You can hear the distant sound of running water and a curious buzzing coming from far below. The stairway twists and turns a long way downward. The floor has been cut into hundreds of shallow steps, but the walls and ceiling are still natural rock. About sixty feet down, a rushing stream spills from a narrow crack to the south and crosses the stairway, disappearing into a narrow, winding tunnel to the north. The rill is only two or three feet wide. Fortunately, you manage to cross without mishap.

The descending fissure opens up abruptly into a very high cavern, its ceiling easily forty feet or more overhead. The stairway continues to wind down along a ledge that follows the north wall of the chamber. A fast-moving stream about five feet wide runs across the floor of the chamber from the north and disappears under a low stone overhang to the south, and larger passageways exit to the south-east and the north-east.

Attracted by your light, you are attacked my more of the blood sucking stirges that inhabit the caves. Remy shoots one and Badger cuts up another. However one of the stirges clamps onto Badger and drinks his blood. Dioica and Claude use their manage to clear the infestation, and Ocardo cuts down the last stirge as it tries to attack Remy.

Dioica suggests you go to the south-east exit and leads you into an extremely large cave faintly lit by natural phosphorescence. Its ceiling rises fifty feet high in places. Crystals glimmer softly in the eerie light. Weird, beautiful flows and structures of delicate stone grace the chamber. The western portion of the great cave is separated from the rest by a steep bluff; the ceiling here is half the height of the rest of the chamber.

Almost two dozen large stone sepulchres line the cavern walls, each carved with intricate reliefs and designs and marked with Dwarvish runes. Badger finds a great cavern to the east while Remy and Ocardo search the tombs. Twenty-three sepulchres stand here. The lids are carved in the likenesses of grim dwarves in armour. Dwarvish runes on the front of each tomb appear to represent the names of the occupants or the intended occupants. Three of the stone coffins have additional runes carved into them.

Remy reads the runes. They record the occupant's date of death and the great deeds the dwarf performed in life. Also carved into these three coffins is a warning that doom awaits any who dare to defile the honourable dead. The names on these three sepulchres are those of Borgol the Old, Gharin Orc-Doom, and Numik the Unlucky.

You suspect the tombs to be trapped or fear that the dwarf remains may rise up to attack. But fortunately there is no danger here. You find Borgol's ring, shaped like a dragon with its tail in its mouth; Gharin's finely crafted war-hammer, inset with a garnet; and poor Numik had nothing of value.

Meanwhile, the great cavern glimmers with a faint phosphorescence. The ceiling is almost fifty feet overhead, and bright flecks and gleaming stone formations are visible in the distance. Patches of strange fungi dot the floor, including capped stalks standing as tall as a human and glowing puffballs almost a yard wide.

High ledges rise fifteen to twenty feet above the floor on the north, south, and west walls. Narrow passageways lead off to the north and the south, and a flight of carved stone stairs descends from the western ledge to a path that meanders through the centre of the chamber toward a small iron door in the eastern wall. Audible throughout the entire chamber is the sigh of a soft, cool breeze that rises toward the surface far above.

Dioica tastes some of the fungus but it doesn't appear to have any effect on her. At the far end of the cavern you find a small but strong-looking door of iron plates, cut into the cavern wall, about five feet tall and four feet wide. Heavy rivets stud its surface, and a tarnished silver rune -- Durgeddin's smith-mark -- gleams on the door's rusted face. Remy tries to pick the lock but only manages to jam shut. Here you miss Bobolink's door opening magic. Claude channels his Knowledge of the Ages to gain proficiency in lock picking. He works careful to unlock the door.

While you are waiting for Claude to open the door, Ocardo and Remy explore a path to the south and Badger and Dioica climb a rocky ledge to the north and are attacked by two worm-like monstrosities that are perfectly camouflaged against the rock walls. They unfurl barbed tentacles as Badger and Dioica approach.

Dioica is struck several times during the assault and Badger is almost consumed. Hearing the commotion, Claude and Remy hurry back but they find it difficult to land a telling blow on the creatures. Eventually Remy manages to skewer one of the gricks with his magic rapier and finally Claude annoyed at all the noise disturbing his concentration blind fires his crossbow over his shoulder and takes out the other grick. He then finally clicks the lock open on Durgeddin's door and uses his curing magic and scrolls to heal the wounded while you decide what to do next.

You decide to search the gricks' lair for treasure. Here you find two more gricks and after another tough battle, you finally manage to defeat them. Claude again heals the party with a Prayer of Healing. Among the grisly remains in the gricks' lair you find a suit of scale mail armour and scattered coins totalling 200 copper pieces, 180 silver pieces, and 60 gold pieces.

Further to the north you find a large, high-ceilinged cavern. To the north, a carved, square-mouthed tunnel shows that someone has been at work in these caves. A gate of rough-hewn timber blocks a small passage to the north-east. Three other passageways wind off toward the south including the one you followed. A heavy animal smell lingers in the air. Suddenly, Ocardo is attacked by a camouflaged troglodyte.

![a picture of a lizard-like humanoid](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/9/108/252/315/636323540010349971.jpeg "Troglodyte")

Ocardo points at creature and issues a Hellish Rebuke. Badger hacks at the creature with his swords and Claude puts a crossbow bolt through its head. However, a second camouflaged troglodyte on the other side of the cavern opens the gate and releases a brown bear.

Remy moves in to attack the second troglodyte but he is overpowered by the creature's stench. Ocardo is also hit with the stench but he manages to abide it and hits the troglodyte and the bear with a Green-Flame Blade. The troglodyte is killed and Dioica uses her Animal Friendship to charm the bear.

The north passage is an old orc tunnel which leads back out onto the mountainside. Dioica decides to release the brown bear back into the wild.

Searching the other exits from the cave you find a trickle of water seeping down from the hillside above reaching into an irregular cavern, nourishing a profusion of fungus -- weird puffballs, tall caps, and patches of fuzzy mould in a variety of colours. A golden-brown carpet of mould covers an old skeleton in rusted mail in the southern part of the room, and a narrow passageway leads to another small room beyond this one. A surprisingly bright sword gleams in the skeleton's bony grasp.

As Dioica grabs the sword, the mould ejects a cloud of spores. Fortunately, the spores do not infect her and she retrieves a magic longsword bearing Durgeddin's mark. You also find a steel helmet chased with silver.

You decide it is time to venture through Durgeddin's door. Beyond the door, steep stone stairs climb northward. The stairs end at the entrance to an octagonal chamber. The floor is inlaid with cracked, dusty blue tiles, and the walls are dressed with polished marble. Large doors of iron-bound oak exit to the north-west and north-east. Three cast bronze statues, almost ten feet tall, stand by the west, north, and east walls. Each depicts an armed dwarf. The eastern and western ones carry axes and shields. The centre statue is armed with two axes. The ceiling rises in a dome almost thirty feet above the floor. And from somewhere in the distance, you can hear the faint ringing of hammer on anvil.

![a picture of a statue of a dwarf holding up two axes](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/106/300/407/totyp-02-10.png "Statue")

You discover that the doors are both traps. But Claude finds a secret door to the east. Climbing the stairs you trigger a magic mouth spell which calls out in Dwarvish, "Alert! Alert! Intruders approach!" At the top of the stairs is a stone door carved with a glowering dwarf's face. It opens easily.

Beyond is an enormous hall, lined with ten great pillars, carved into the forms of giants and dragons, that support the vaulted ceiling high above. Guttering orange torches set in sconces along the walls illuminate the room, and a mighty throne sits on a dais at the opposite end. The walls were once covered with tile mosaics, but they have been smashed and defiled by graffiti. Tiny fragments of tile litter the floor. You can see five other exits. A small fire smoulders on the floor before the dais, where six sleeping pallets lie empty, surrounded by packs and supplies. The sound of hammers ringing on iron comes from beyond the doors to the south.

Suddenly a harsh female voice calls from the shadows of the pillars, "Go back the way you came! This is the only warning you'll get!" Remy decides to turn on the charm but she does not appear impressed. However he suspects that she might be open to a bribe and so offers her gold in exchange for information. She accepts and shows herself. She is a duergar. She calls herself Ghared and claims that her and her party are restoring the forge. She offers the following information:

- The doors to the north lead to halls infested with undead and cursed magic.
- The door to the south-west leads into the old kitchens, guarded by more cursed magic.
- A dragon lives in a large lake cavern deep below.
- The subterranean river flows from the lake through other parts of the complex below the Glitterhame. It's fed from a lake on the surface.

Remy attempts to push his luck and try to convince Ghared to let them through the other doors. She plays along at first but then makes a lightening fast grab for his rapier. Fortunately, Remy is quicker. However, two more invisible duergar are in the room and attack Dioica and Ocardo. As they attack they become visible and enlarge themselves to twice their normal size.

Claude casts hold person on Ghared however her duergar resilience allows her to shrug off the effect. Remy strikes with his rapier inflicted a serious wound. But Ghared uses her cunning action to evade him and makes her own sneak attack on Claude. One of the duergar guards takes down Ocardo and the other hits Dioica. But you manage to defeat the duergar. And you find a potion of healing on Ghared.

Claude heals the party and you decide to secure the hall and rest to recover your strength. It is hard to rest with the hammering from the south but you are not otherwise disturbed.

After resting you decide to explore north-west door. Through the door is a room that was once a shrine to the gods of the dwarves. The walls are carved with their dour images, and a low stone altar stands at the western end of the room. Stone benches have been smashed and thrown askew, and the icons of the gods have been defaced. Atop the altar, arms folded over his chest, lies the ancient corpse of a dwarf warrior in plate armour. Bones lie heaped around the altar's base, and at its foot crouches the desiccated body of an orc in studded leather.

Ocardo cannot resist investigating. As he approaches, some of the bones at the foot of the altar stir and form into a pair of towering skeletons clutching great-clubs. The dead orc warrior looks up at you and grins evilly, green fire burning in its hate-filled eyes as it stands. You battle the ogre skeletons and the dead orc. The orc is not harmed by non-magical weapons. Claude suspects that the creature is a wight and that its has life draining abilities.

The ogre skeletons take a lot of chopping down but with the whole party working together and Badger making reckless attacks you eventually manage to destroy the undead. Among the bones, you find a sack containing 280 gold pieces, and a bone case containing spell scrolls of web and spider climb.
