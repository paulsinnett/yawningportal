In Neverwinter, Remy uses his contacts to arrange passage on a merchant ship headed for Chult. You all stock up on supplies. Remy buys a suit of +1 studded leather armour. Badger swaps the +1 longsword for a +1 scimitar and buys a +1 short-sword. Ocardo purchases 4 potions of greater healing. And Dioica convinces the druids to silver your weapons.

With your preparations complete, you set sail for the mysterious jungle island. It takes a couple of weeks to cross the sea and reach Port Nyanzaru. There you find the weather hot and humid. The locals there are friendly and most Chultans speak the common trading tongue. It doesn't take you get directions from the local druids and find a guide to lead you into the jungle of the interior. You stock up on provision before heading south.

After a week of travel you arrive in the vicinity of the recently uncovered ruins. As you head toward the pyramid temple, you tread across cracked and overgrown flagstones, stepping over fallen and shattered pillars, pushing aside vines and briers. When you are nearly at the temple, the sound of creatures crashing through the under-brush comes from behind you. You turn around to see people moving through the woods toward the clearing around the pyramid. Then, suddenly, the earth shudders and gapes open beneath your feet and you are falling amid the roar of collapsing masonry. Dust fills the air and the sunlight disappears as the darkness swallows you.

There is an irritating amber coloured gas mixed in the air here. Fire burns less readily in this atmosphere and you determine that the gas is toxic and slowly poisoning you. It is light and accumulates near the ceiling. You are in a long, narrow chamber, running east-west. In the center of this apartment is a domed shape on the floor. In the east wall is a blank-faced stone door. The west end of the room is blocked by fallen stone and rubble, apparently the result of a collapse. The two side walls appear to have several niches cut into them.

The shape in the center of the chamber appears to be a small alcove, protected by a half-dome with the open end facing toward the door in the east wall. This alcove is set in a recessed, shallow, tiled well, one foot deep and ten feet wide. The alcove itself is four feet high. The recess contains some sort of display.

The display appears to be a diorama depicting a hunting party of Olman warriors, in feathers and deer-hide garments, in a mountainside scene. Some have pulled down a stag with the aid of a dog, another group is cleaning a small mule deer, and others have cornered a panther with their spears. A scout watches the panther from an outcropping above. He holds a metal staff with a loop in its end. It looks like a shepherd's crook.

The three niches on both the northern and southern walls are five feet wide and about three feet off the floor. Each niche contains a diorama depicting some aspect of tribal life. The six-inch-tall figures in all of the displays appear to be made of stucco, realistically and brightly painted. The scenes portrayed represent fishing, farming, religion, warfare, the creation story, and crafting.

A cave-in completely blocks the west end of the chamber. At short intervals, small amounts of rubble and dirt come spilling into the room. Several large stones appear to have wedged themselves tightly, closing the collapse.

The door is carved with a sun symbol and appears to open into the room; there are hinges on this side and scratches on the floor. There is no visible lock or handle on it, although a slight gap stretches across the top of the door. Eight holes seem to have been bored into the door; they are about an inch in diameter, but nothing can be seen in them. The door seems to be fairly thick. The lintel is arched, with a keystone at the top.

Ocardo breaks the two hinge pins holding up the door and you lower the door into the room. Beyond is a corridor, the stone walls of which, are carved to resemble a stack of bamboo-like logs. The passage slopes down from a single door on its western leg, the lintel of which has been crafted to represent a stylized cavern entrance. It leads to double doors of beaten bronze, worked to resemble a forest of seaweed.

You approach the double doors and feel the floor shift beneath your feet. Several of the logs swing out hitting Ocardo and Badger, splitting your party and blocking the passage. It takes you a while to clear the logs to regroup and the toxic gas begins to affect you all. The doors beyond open easily into the next room.

This room is constructed of large stone blocks, buttressed in the corners. The walls are wet and slimy, and mud covers most of the floor in a thin coating. To the east and west may be seen stone doors recessed in the wall, and to the north a set of stairs leads down. In the center of the chamber sits a large polished boulder amid a pile of smaller rounded rocks. The boulder is five feet tall and coloured brown with dark streaks and spots. Leaning against it is what appears to be a bamboo staff. In the mud around the base of the boulder is a moving shape, looking like a crayfish. It is facing you and seems to be aware of your presence.

Dioica speaks with the creature. It advances, waving its claws, "Who is this? Who dares enter the chamber of the guardian? You had better go, or I will have to discharge my sacred duty! Be off with you before I lose my temper!" Dioica manages to placate the crustacean and asks to speak to the guardian. The crayfish taps on the boulder with a claw. But in fact this is merely the shell of a giant hermit crab; the 'bamboo staff' being one of its legs. The crab calls itself Kalka-Kylla.

Kalka-Kylla claims to have no knowledge of the layout of the temple, stating that it was brought into these warrens when it was vary young. You ask it for directions anyway and it suggests you try to the east.

The walls of this corridor are wet and slimy. The stucco covering has become saturated with water and is decomposing and sloughing off in spots on the southern wall, exposing the seams of one of the large stone blocks from which this structure was built. You travel through, being careful of triggering any more traps. The corridor turns north and ends at a staircase. This staircase goes up for only a few steps, and then it seems that the rest is filled in with clay and stone rubble.

You backtrack to the exposed stone block. With some effort you manage to push it in enough that you can get into the room behind. Beyond the plug is a small foyer holding three sealed urns on the east and west sides. To the south are double doors of bronze with glyphs worked into their faces. You are unable to read the glyphs. Badger carefully examines the urns. Each urn is sealed with beeswax and contains the equivalent of twenty flasks of oil.

Remy detects that the doors are trapped but he is unable to disarm it. Ocardo decides to blast the doors open from a distance. Behind the doors, a glass sphere is broken releasing a swirling green gas throughout the area. Behind the doors is a chamber cut out of the rock with a veil of calcite and stalactites covering the walls. Buttresses rise from the corners, brown shot through with black, and triangular stone pillars support the high ceiling. Occupying the center of the chamber is a colossal monument resembling a giant's table, covered on all sides with intricate carvings and glyphs. Engraved on the floor in front of the entrance is a seal that displays more glyphs. Opposite the entrance, a battleaxe is embedded in the wall, six feet above the floor.

![a picture of an axe embedded in a stone wall casting a shadow that looks like a withered arm](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/thumbnails/2/109/300/334/totyp-03-04.png "the axe")

Badger first attempts to grab the axe, holding his breathe to avoid the green gas. As he approaches within reach he feels a cold chill run up and down his spine. And he can see that it casts an ominous shadow in the shape of what appears to be a withered arm. He also finds it impossible to budge. You try examining the monument instead. Remy detects that one of the glyphs is a glyph of warding. You carefully remove that glyph and press on other glyphs corresponding to the carvings. There is a grating sound and with several of you all lifting together you are able to uncover the tomb lid.

The block beneath the slab is hollow, and inside is a crumbling skeleton decked out in decayed finery. It appears to have been a man of taller than average stature, obviously of great importance. Gems and other small adornments of obvious value lie on and around the body. Covering the skull is a mask of jade with cowrie-shell eyes and obsidian pupils. About the corpse's neck is a jade pendant carved with the face of a human-like bat. You attempt to take the mask and the pendant. And as soon as you do, the corpse begins to reanimate. You quickly put the items back and regroup outside the chamber to plan your next move.

Badger suggests that you fill the tomb with oil and then hold a burning torch above it with a mage hand spell. He'll trigger the corpse and then you drop the torch. The plan works well enough. And with blasts from Ocardo and other ranged attacks you manage to defeat the undead creature quickly. And with the creature destroyed, the axe loses its odd shadow and you pull it from the wall.

In addition to the battleaxe, you find the following items:

- a mask
- a pendant
- a spherical white onyx
- black obsidian and red pipe-stone tubes
- a diadem of dark opals and jade discs
- a pair of jade earrings
- a tubular jade and bone breastplate
- 56 jade beads
- wide jade bracelets
- a jade ring of a man holding the moon
- a jade ring of a panther ready to strike
- a jade cube
- a spherical agate
- the dried remains of a potion
- a 1 inch diameter pieces of mother of pearl
- a 6 inch long statue of a faceless man with large pointed ears containing a potion
