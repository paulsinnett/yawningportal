	<h1>The Forge of Fury: Part 3</h1>
	<p>
		Bobolink, riding on Poon Tang in her wolf form, catches up with the trader from Blasingdell in a rest house on the
		road south. He recognises you from Blasingdell as your arrival had caused quite a stir. You hand him the package you
		wish taken to the orphanage in Waterdeep and he agrees to deliver it for you. He says that there is a rumour that the
		druids are gathering and that since you know a druid he imagines she would want to know too.
	</p>
	<p>
		After a brief rest, you head back to follow the trail of the rest of your party. You head towards the Stone
		Tooth
		and with Poon Tang following their tracks you find your way in through the fortress and caves and into the forge. You
		trigger the magic alarm on the stairs and meet the rest of your party as they are resting after their fight with the
		orcish wight.
	</p>
	<p>
		Bobolink informs Dioica about the druids and she decides to leave the forge and commune with nature to find out
		what&rsquo;s going on. Meanwhile the rest of you decide to explore the forge further. The easternmost door in the
		north
		wall opens into a large chamber with a dark pool in the center. Bits of smashed furniture and other debris are
		scattered about the floor. Hallways lead off to the east and the west. A weird moaning fills the area, slowly
		becoming recognizable as Dwarvish curses. The sound rises to angry shouting and grows closer. Then the translucent
		form of an armoured dwarf appears through a wall. The horrifying visage of the ghost causes Remy, Bobolink, and Poon
		Tang to visibly age.
	</p>
	<p>
		You attack the ghost with your magic weapons, but the ghostly spirit moves into Badger&rsquo;s body. For a moment he
		is
		unable to
		respond. Bobolink grabs him and tries to drown him in the pool to force the ghost to leave his body. Remy intervenes
		and drags Bobolink away while Claude fails to turn the ghost. Poon Tang throws some holy water at Badger,
		but misses and the possessed Badger climbs out of the pool. Ocardo and Bobolink jump on him and hold him down while
		Remy ties him up and Poon Tang pours holy water down his throat. The ghost leaves Badger&rsquo;s body. You
		then continue to attack with your magic weapons and spells while Badger attempts to escape from the ropes. Remy
		finally destroys the ghost with a well aimed magic arrow.
	</p>
	<p>
		You search the hallway to the west, listening carefully at the doors. Ocardo searches one room but it contains only
		smashed furniture and other debris, graffiti in the Orc language, and the skeletal remains of dwarves and orcs. He
		arranges
		the corpses into compromising positions.
	</p>
	<p>
		Meanwhile, Bobolink opens a door into a chamber that might once have been a barracks. The remains of six wooden bunks
		lean
		against the walls, burned and hacked by pillagers, and half a dozen skeletal dwarves lie here and there on the floor.
		With clicking and scraping sounds, the skeletons rise and advance! Bobolink casts invisibility on himself and calls
		for help. You hold the door on the skeletons long enough to get into position and then open the door and Poon Tang
		throws in some alchemists&rsquo; fire. You fight it out with the skeletal dwarves while Bobolink continues to
		invisibly open
		doors.
	</p>
	<p>
		When you have defeated the skeletons, you search the barracks and find the body of a rogue from the
		failed expedition. Her belt pouch contains 670 silver pieces. You take the coins and head back to the
		pool to take a short rest while Bobolink continues to explore the hallway to the east.
	</p>
	<p>
		The hallway leads to a large open chamber. Three doors open into it, and a dark pool fills a low stone basin in its
		center. The chamber is littered with the remains of old warriors. Seven dwarf corpses lie where they fell a hundred
		years ago, surrounded by the remains of at least a dozen orc warriors. The dead have been stripped of their arms and
		armour; only a handful of broken weapons and shattered shields remain. Bobolink opens a door to the south.
	</p>
	<p>
		It opens into a room that was once a library or a study. Bookshelves stand against the walls. Piles of books rest on
		a reading table in the middle of the room. The air reeks of mouldy paper. Other doors in the room lead east, and
		south. A beautiful, slender woman with long black hair sits in a chair at the table, looking extremely sad. Her
		clothing, though well worn, does little to detract from her appearance. She gets up, closes the door, and returns
		to her reading. Bobolink sneaks invisibly through the room and into a small library where he finds many old papers
		detailing the history of Khundrukar. After searching through the papers he returns to the others before his
		invisibility wears off.
	</p>
	<p>
		You work your way down the eastern hallway. The first door in the
		southern wall of the hallway opens into a chamber which must once have been the personal quarters of an
		important dwarf. It is decorated with tapestries and furnished comfortably, although age has taken its toll on the
		contents. Apparently, the room has not been looted. A beautiful rug covers the center of the floor, and a simple bed
		and writing desk stand in the southwest corner. Ocardo and Remy enter. Ocardo strides across the rug and is attacked!

	</p>

	<p>Bobolink closes the door on Remy and Ocardo. They manage to chop up the rug. Beneath the bed they find a small
		wooden
		chest containing 1,200 silver pieces,
		3,000 copper pieces and a square of silk containing a star sapphire and a pair of matching blue topazes. Ocardo takes
		the sapphire and Remy takes the topazes.</p>
	<p>A couple of doors down you also find a room containing rows of empty weapon racks and a dozen or more armour stands
		indicating that this room was once an armoury. Some debris litters the floor, but nothing of value is readily
		apparent except one suit in the corner. Remy goes to explore and is attacked by the armour!
	</p>
	<img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/8/429/241/315/636306156895834255.jpeg" alt="Armour" />
	<p>You attack the amour but it is difficult to do it any damage. Finally Ocardo is able to destroy it using
		Shatterspike. A search of the debris turns up a hand axe bearing Durgeddin&rsquo;s mark which Badger takes. Searches
		of the
		remaining rooms finally turns up a gem; an eye agate.</p>
	<p>Claude then leads the party into the library room that Bobolink had explored while invisible. He introduces himself
		and your party. The woman says that her name is Idalla and that she has been imprisoned in the forge by an evil
		dwarf wizard known as Numik and she begs that you defeat him and free her. You agree and escort her back to the
		great hall. She gives you the following pieces of information:<ul>
			<li>the wizard lives in the level below</li>
			<li>he has told her the history of Khundrukar and the fate of Durgeddin</li>
			<li>a doppelganger lurks in the Glitterhame</li>
			<li>a dead dwarf haunts the halls, reduced to a mad gibbering spirit</li>
			<li>an ancient dragon lairs below the Foundry</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p>You decide to open the door behind the throne while Bobolink escorts Idalla down to the caves. He tells you that
		he intends to escort Idalla back to Blasingdell. But actually he just wants to get her on her own. And Idalla is
		agreeable. Claude gives Bobolink a secret password in case he falls victim to a doppelganger.</p>
	<p>
		The door behind the throne leads into a small audience chamber. A large table made of a single stone slab dominates
		the room&rsquo;s center, and old tapestries cling to the walls. A stone door in the far wall is carved with the
		dwarf&rsquo;s
		visage that you&rsquo;ve seen elsewhere.
		One gray-skinned dwarf in scale mail and shield stands watch by the far door. He shouts and raises a javelin.
	</p>
	<p>You engage the duergar guard in combat. His shouts draw out another duergar through the door at the other end of
		the chamber. She is armed with a greatsword and armoured in splint mail. You manage to defeat the guard but their
		leader
		is harder to take down. Eventually, she turns herself invisible and flees the room. You chase after her into the next
		room.</p>
	<p>This room appears to be a bedchamber. In one corner to the south stands a large wooden sleeping platform, badly
		gouged by axe blows and partially burned. A table, a bench, and a writing desk have been similarly treated. In the
		middle of the southern wall, a space has been cleared for a simple sleeping pallet, and a pair of large satchels. Two
		doors exit the room to the north. The far door to the north is ajar. Remy follows and discovers a closet containing
		a secret door. You go through and attempt to track the fleeing duergar.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile in the chamber of statues Bobolink discovers that Idalla is unable to leave the chamber. She claims to
		experience pain when attempting to exit the forge. Bobolink tries his luck and Idalla kisses him. But her kiss is
		deadly and Bobolink gains no satisfaction from it, experiencing only pain and a profound emptiness. Her true form
		is a succubus!
	</p>
	<img src="https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/avatars/thumbnails/0/103/235/315/636252742573312994.jpeg" alt="Idalla" />
	<p>Bobolink survives the draining kiss, but she charms him before he can get away.</p>
	<p>Meanwhile the rest of you follow the duergar leader through the secret passageway, back through the common area
		with the pool, and back into the great hall. There you meet up with Bobolink and Idalla. They explain how Idalla
		is unable to leave the Foundry. Bobolink seems somewhat drained and smitten with Idalla.
	</p>
	<p>You chase the duergar leader through the southern door into the bladeworks where hammering can still be heard.
		Double stone doors lead into a barrel-vaulted area containing several furnaces. The eastern end of the chamber
		continues into a large, dark cave, from which a cold wind moans. A stream of water rushes from west to east through
		the center of the room, crossed by two stone bridges. On the other side of the stream, three bald, gray dwarves work
		at a roaring forge, beating a white-hot blade into shape on an old anvil. The two smiths grab their weapons and
		enlarge themselves and guard the two bridges. The remaining duergar begins to cast a spell.</p>
	<p>Remy hits the spellcaster with an arrow and Claude casts toll the dead. Unnoticed, a small rat emerges from one
		of the unlit forges and runs up to Remy. The spellcasting duergar casts shocking grasp on Remy using the rat as his
		conduit. The invisible duergar leader makes a stealth attack on Ocardo but his hellish rebuke takes her out of the
		battle. Badger pushes one of the duergar off of the bridge and into the fast running stream. He is swept away to
		the east. Remy crushes the spellcaster&rsquo;s familiar. Bobolink tries to get Idalla out of the way of the fighting.
		You split into two groups and attack the remaining duergar. Finally, Bobolink takes out the spellcaster with a
		chromatic orb
		and Poon Tang takes down the last duergar with a shot from her bow.
	</p>
	<p>In the cold forge in the northwest corner of the room, you find 320 gp, 1,100 sp, a gold necklace set
		with ruby stones, and a potion.</p>
