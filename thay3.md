# Dead in Thay: Part 3

Having despatched the undead guards and sent the tortured demon back to its own plane, you decide to move on. The double doors in the middle of the west wall are not locked and lead into a small passage blocked by a white gate. You use one of your glyph keys to open it and continue west to another set of double doors. This opens into what looks like a prison.

Several cages line this chamber from floor to ceiling. Three of them hold various demons, which are raging futilely and silently against their confinement. The wall in the southwest corner contains a contact stone.

One cell contains a large spiky frog-like demon, another contains eight tiny bat-like demons, a third contains two large bird shaped demons. The rest of the cells lay empty. Each cell has iron bars scribed with runes which ward against the demons.

The demons are guarded by a red wizard, a deathlock wight, and a Thayan apprentice. Remy attempts to smooth talk the wizard but he doesn't appear to have anything that can help you so you decide to attack. The battle is short and despite their magic, you defeat them without too much trouble.

The wizard has a glyph key attuned to the _Abyssal Prisons_ zone and the _Abyssal Gate_. He also has a set of keys and a small glowing orb. You examine the orb and it floats into the air and expands into a large spherical portal, glowing with all the colours of the rainbow. The portal shatters and out falls Bobolink.

Bobolink tells you that he had been tricked into a pocket dimension by a duplicitous red wizard. You tell him of your adventures through the Doomvault so far.

Ocardo feels that _Blackrazor_ was denied the satisfaction of killing the jailers so he decides to free the bird like demons. He unlocks the door. These creatures let out a stunning screech. You manage to defeat one of the demons and lock the other back into its cage. But _Blackrazor_ is still hungry.

While you are recovering, Ocardo opens the door to the large spiky frog-like demon. The demon busts out.

It emits a foul stench causing those nearby to retch uncontrollably. It is resistant to most of your magic, but you manage to defeat it anyway. _Blackrazor_ as before, is denied a meal.

You try to placate Ocardo and decide to move on further into the Doomvault on the understanding that there will assuredly be more lives to consume as you continue. There is a passage leading southwest from the jail. You follow it to a passage leading west and ending in double doors. You open the doors into a large square room.

The walls here consist of worked stone, but the thirty-foot-high ceiling of this broad chamber features rough rock hung with jagged stalactites. Seams in the floor tiles divide the space into squares five feet on a side. An open pit extends halfway across each of the four entryways, just inside the room.

You detect strong magic coming from the open mouths of each pit. You decide to go around the pits and have worked your way into the room when suddenly, the gravity in the room reverses and you find yourselves falling up to the ceiling and dashed on the stalactites. You attempt to attach yourselves to the ceiling but before you can do so, the gravity changes again and you fall back to the stone floor. The gravity appears to switch every minute so you quickly make for the doors in the west wall.

These doors open into another chamber. This ruined chamber has tapestries and paintings that have been slashed and are shot through with black mould. The fine furnishings and cushions are rotted through and crumbling, and the air is heavy with the scent of decay. You are searching through the room, when suddenly a ghost appears.

"Allies of the Red Wizards must die!" it screams and attacks you. You manage to repel its attacks and cause it to discorporate. _Whelm_ detects the presence of a secret door within this room. You find it and detect that it is also trapped with fake locks. The real locks are at the base and Remy opens them without much trouble. The passage beyond leads southwest, via another white gate, and ends at a further secret door.

You decide to return and clear the area marked _Halls of Conditioning_ before moving on. You return to the gravity trap room and head south. A short hall of gray granite runs perpendicular to this areaâ€™s entrance, with six openings across from the entrance that lead deeper into the darkness. The cold stone ceiling looms thirty feet overhead. In front of each pillar, the floor radiates with conjuration magic. The entrance also radiates with abjuration magic.

Bobolink ventures in. As soon as he steps on the zone in front of the first pillar he vanishes from sight. He finds himself falling upwards and tries to flip himself upside down. Unfortunately he is unable to steady himself, hits a ceiling, and then falls back to the ground. And as soon as he touches the ground he is teleported again. Bobolink eventually finds his footing somewhere on the ceiling, somewhere inside this maze of pillars. But as the rest of you are deciding what to do, you detect that he is not alone.

In the darkness of the maze, Bobolink discovers that a demon is hunting him. He attempts to evade the creature, while Ocardo checks out the black gate at the south end of the room. It seems like just another black gate so Ocardo decides to give _Blackrazor_ another chance at a meal and challenges the demon. The rest of you enter the maze through various means and engage the demon in combat; some from above and some from below. The demon manages to catch a couple of you in its giant claws, but with a combination of magic and weapon attacks, you manage to defeat the demon.

With the demon defeated and the secret of safe travel through the maze uncovered, you make your way back to the secret passage and cross once again into the zone of the predator pools. The secret door opens into a corridor running southeast and up some stairs. Remy detects more pit traps here. The stairs lead up into the next area.

Gigantic steel bolts have been driven into the stone floor of this immense area, attached to heavy chains. These trail down into the water of a vast pool situated between curving northern and southern staircases that lead up to double doors. Two enormous globes of blue liquid are suspended in the air to the east.

A young dragon turtle rises from the vast curving pool. _Wave_ telepathically communicates with the creature in the Aquan language. It tells you that it is being held prisoner by a Naga. With _Wave's_ help, you manage to convince the creature to help you defeat the Naga. However, while you are discussing your plans and freeing the turtle, Ocardo and _Blackrazor_ decide to take matters into their own hands. Ocardo ascends the stairs to the Naga's chamber with Badger close behind.

Inside, magical light shimmers off two circular pools in this chamber. A glowing glyph covers a broad area of the floor in the south. On the eastern wall is a contact stone. In the pools, ten human commoners are being held prisoner, and the Naga is currently feasting on another. The Naga is outraged by this intrusion and instructs the humans in the pools to eject Ocardo. They obey as if magically compelled.

Ocardo attempts to engage the Naga in combat while he and Badger are swarmed by the human commoners. _Blackrazor_ begins to cut through and consume the human souls. Meanwhile Remy has climbed the other stairs and attacks the Naga from behind. The battle does not look like lasting long when suddenly Bobolink appears at the top of the stairs and casts a _fireball_ into the room.

The Naga and its human captives are burned to death, and Ocardo and Badger suffer some damage. Bobolink and Badger then trade blows. But, for the moment at least, _Blackrazor_ appears content. At the bottom of the pool's connecting tunnel, you find the following items of treasure:

- 200 platinum pieces
- 5 tourmaline jewels
- magical plate armour
- a sealed ivory case

Inside the case are seven spell scrolls:

- 2 _detect magic_ scrolls
- 2 _identify_ scrolls
- 2 _lesser restoration_ scrolls
- a _remove curse_ scroll

Finally, on the body of the Naga you find:

- a platinum circlet set with sapphires and matching earrings
- a glyph key attuned to the _Predator Pools_ zone, and to the _Warrior Pools_, _Spawn Pools_, and _Blood Pools_ gates.
