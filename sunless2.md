# The Sunless Citadel: Part 2

In the relative safety of the kobold held territory, you learn that the kobolds have recently claimed a part of the citadel from the goblins of the Durbuluk tribe. The kobolds believe that the citadel is rightfully theirs as it is dedicated to the worship of Ashardalon the dragon. Although, Remy and Ocardo note that the construction of the citadel is distinctively elvish. The kobolds hold the main hall and the surrounding rooms, the goblins hold the area to the north of them. The goblins and the kobolds frequently raid each others areas capturing prisoners and trading back and forth for ransom.

The north-east is infested by rats so both the kobolds and the goblins tend to avoid that area. The previous adventuring party took the north-east route to find a back way to the goblin territory. The kobolds have not heard from them since. But the goblins that stole Calcryx also came from that direction and were lead by Balsag, a 'large hairy goblin' with two giant rats under his command. Dioica suspects from Meepo's description, that Balsag is not a goblin, but something else; possibly a bear.

Badger intimidates the kobolds' current goblin prisoners and finds out that the lower levels of the citadel are held by Belak the druid and that it is Belak that gets the goblins to sell the magic fruit in Oakhurst. He then pays the kobold jailers the price of a goblin foot and claims it from one unfortunate goblin prisoner; eating it raw in front of them; much to the kobolds amusement.

As you realise that you will be resting for a while, Princess goes back up the ravine to see to the horses. She sings them a song, magically instructing them to return to Oakhurst, with a note for Kerowyn the merchant to see to their stabling until the party return.

You rest and heal yourselves before continuing on the trail of the captured dragon Calcryx. On entering the rat infested area of the citadel, you are once again able to pick up the tracks of the previous adventuring party. You find a dried up fountain in the shape of a dragon with an inscription which when read aloud in draconic causes the fountain to produce one last glob of reddish liquid. You collect the liquid in a container and, after some experimentation, discover it to be a potion of fire breath.

Opposite the fountain is a door, cold to the touch, with an inscription that reads 'rebuke the dead, open the way' in draconic. Remy investigates the door and finds that it is trapped. He blocks the trap but is unable to unlock the door. Bobalink however is able to crack the lock. Unfortunately, Remy's attempt to disable the trap was ineffective and a scything blade swings down. Bobalink survives, but not entirely unscathed.

Inside is a sanctuary holding the dusty sarcophagi of five elven nobles dressed in ceremonial robes. At the far end of the room is an altar, with images of dragons carved into its black obsidian. A single candle burns brightly with a continual flame. Next to the candle are a small crystal whistle and flask. Ocardo leads the party into the room and takes the whistle to examine it. The moment he does so, the skeletons of the elven nobles emerge from their sarcophagi and attack. In the ensuing battle, Pom Pom retrieves the whistle for Princess to examine. The whistle is inscribed with the name *Night Caller* in Dwarfish. She remembers from her knowledge of fairy tales, that whistles like this were created by the duergar (the grey dwarves of the Underdark) to call and control the undead. She blows the whistle and is able to take control of one of the elven skeletons. She names him 'Tree Trunks' and turns him against his fellow skeletons. You manage to dispatch the remaining skeletons and find that the crystal flask contains a potion of fire resistance. Badger takes the candle of continual flame and puts it in his lantern.

You continue north and find an array of prison cells, each of which has become home to a giant rat. Although individually the rats are quite weak, they attack as a pack and gnaw some serious damage into Tree Trunks' old bones. After you've killed the rats, you take a short rest and patch yourselves up. Princess sings a song of rest and manages to patch up Tree Trunks.

The next chamber has two pit traps, one at its entrance and one at its exit to the west. The traps have already been disabled, presumably by the previous adventuring party. There is another fountain here with the inscription 'let there be death' in draconic. Dioica once again reads aloud the inscription and prepares to collect another potion, however, this fountain belches out a cloud of poison gas. Fortunately, as a Dioica has a green dragon heritage, she has some resistance to poison and is only momentarily poisoned by the gas.

The smell of rotting meat comes from the door to the west. Beyond it, you find a giant and bloated rat which Meepo calls Guthash. She is apparently the mother to all the giant rats in the citadel. Badger is swarmed by a pack of giant rats and overwhelmed but Pom Pom grabs him and pulls him away from danger. Princess puts Guthash to sleep with a magical song and you defeat the rest of rats with a combination of magic and weapons. Badger is revived and delivers a coup de grace on the sleeping Guthash, however, the bloated rat explodes covering Badger in diseased rat offal. Unfortunately, Badger contracts the disease from the rat. Dioica diagnoses the disease but it is currently beyond her ability to cure him. She expects that he will slowly waste away unless he receives some restorative magic.

In among the filth of the rats' nest you find several goblin and kobold corpses and one dead human. The human has a gold ring with the name Karakas engraved in it. Karakas was the name of the ranger in the adventuring party you are following. Among his belongings you find additional supplies and a potion of healing. There is no sign of what happened to the rest of the adventuring party.

You backtrack to a door you have yet to open and continue westward. You continue cautiously. You slowly open the door to the next chamber and thereby avoid ringing the bell attached to the other side. The floor of the room is covered with caltrops, and at the end of the room is a low crenelated wall. You carefully pick their way through the caltrops and avoid alerting the goblin archers camping beyond the wall. You are able to surprise and defeat the goblins without too much trouble.

The next area however, is harder to navigate. It is an archery practice range with another crenelated wall at the end, and the goblins stationed here are already alerted due to the death cries of their fellows. Dioica transforms herself into a tiny spider and crawls unnoticed across the ceiling and behind the goblin archers. Once she is in place, Pom Pom runs in and is peppered with arrows. (Again, you notice that Pom Pom appears immune to mundane weapon attacks.) The rest of you charge the goblins, while Dioica returns to dragonborn form and breathes poison gas. Again you cut down the goblins. However this time, one manages to escape into the hall to the north. It bangs on the door across the hall to raise the alarm, before begin skewered to the door by an arrow.

The door opens and the room contains a group of goblin bandits. It's a tough battle in confined quarters, but you manage to prevail. However Dioica is knocked unconscious during the fighting and you decide to rest and recover your strength before attempting to go any further. Although, not before Remy falls headlong into another pit trap while checking the door at the end of the hall. He does however manage to find a long-lost gold ring with an inset sapphire for his trouble.
