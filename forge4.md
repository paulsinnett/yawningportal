# Forge of Fury

You took rest after dealing with the Duergar to recover your health and abilities. You are joined by Dioica once she has finished communing with nature. You recap your adventures and she tells you that the druids are requesting that she lead an investigation into a new vampire threat discovered in a temple in the depths of the rainforest on the Isle of Chult.

As you rest you consider your next move. You talk about Arundil, the mad mage.

You follow the water until it falls into a wide chasm. Dioica considers changing form while Badger attempts to talk to the resident wild-life to see what is around. You find a ledge on the opposite side with a ladder leading down. Consulting your maps you think there must be a secret passage on the other side of the forge leading to the legde. You find your way around and find the secret door leading to the ledge.

Before descending to face the wizard and the dragon, you decide to backtrack and take a look into the kitchen. In the kitchen, the large kitchen table comes alive and charges into Ocardo. Badger, Poon Tang, and Bobolink counter attack with weapons and magic but the table still manages to bash into Bobolink. Unfortunately, the hit doesn't break Ivara's charm over him. Finally, Ocardo smashes the magically animated table with Shatterspike.

Badger stands watch ready to attack the next thing that moves in the kitchen, while the rest of you search the room. You find nothing valuable in here and no more objects in the kitchen animate.

You decide to return to the ledge and climb down the ladder into the darkness of the level below. Badger lights the way with his lantern. At the bottom of the ladder you find dragon tracks.

You find the bridges and the dark lake. You consider using the feather token to create a magical swan boat, but you decide that the water here is too narrow. Remy, Badger and Ocardo lead the way. With two of you on the old bridge, it crumbles into the water and you are forced to jump to the other side.

You make your way around the edge of the lake to the stepping stones. Suddenly the ugly face of a black dragon rises from the water and breathes its acid breath over you. Dioica, Bobolink, and Poon Tang are overcome by the acid. It then dives beneath the surface. A swarm of stinging insects attacks you in the dragon's lair. You decide to flee back to the ladder, carrying the fallen with you. Ocardo covers your escape with his Darkness spell. Badger and Remy stabilse the unconscious while Claude heals them. You then retreat back up the ladder to consider your next move.
