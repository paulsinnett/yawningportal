# Forge of Fury: Part 4

You rest after dealing with the Duergar to recover your health and abilities. You are joined by Dioica once she has finished communing with nature. You recap your adventures and she tells you that the druids have questioned Belak and are now requesting that she investigate a new vampire threat on the Isle of Chult. Claude identifies Badger's magic axe as a vicious hand-axe. As you rest you consider your next move.

You follow the water flowing as it meanders through the blade-works into a natural cavern before tumbling into a great chasm. You can see nothing but darkness below, although the splashing of waters deep below is barely audible over the roar of the waterfall. To the north of the chasm, a small ledge is partially hidden by a spur of rock. Dioica considers changing form while Badger uses his spirit seeker abilities to talk to the resident creatures. Ocardo with his devil's sight sees a chain ladder in the darkness leading down from the ledge. Consulting your maps you think there must be a secret passage on the other side of the forge leading to the ledge. You find your way back through the forge to find the secret door leading to the ledge.

But before descending to face the wizard and the dragon, you decide to backtrack and clear the haunted kitchen. The stairs leading south from the pillared hall end at a wooden door. Beyond is a corridor that opens up into a large room lined with hearths. This room must once have served as the kitchen: pots, pans, cauldrons, and kettles lie scattered on the floor and strewn across several tables. An archway to the west leads into a pantry filled with rotted foodstuffs. Suddenly, you hear a scraping sound, and a big wooden table shudders and begins to move, heading right for you!

The table charges into Ocardo. Badger, Poon Tang, and Bobolink counter attack with weapons and fire magic but the table survives long enough to bash into Bobolink. Unfortunately, the hit doesn't break Idalla's charm over him. Finally, Ocardo smashes the magically animated table with Shatterspike. Badger stands watch, ready to attack the next thing that moves in the kitchen, while the rest of you search the room. However, you find nothing valuable in here and nothing else in the kitchen attacks you.

You decide to return to the ledge and climb down the ladder into the darkness of the level below. Badger lights the way with his lantern. At the bottom you find a chamber filled with the spray of water from the nearby waterfall. The air is damp, and the roar of the waterfall is deafening. A broad ledge heads north toward the river and then turns out of sight to the east. The muddy bank of the pool looks disturbed by tracks of some kind. You identify these as belonging to a large lizard-like creature dragging a long heavy tail behind it.

A fast-moving underground river roars from east to west under a stone bridge. The bottom of the chain ladder is near the south bank of the river. On the north side of the bridge, a ledge continues to the east. After a short distance, the ledge leading east bends to the south, and a second bridge surmounts the river. The first bridge is solid but you find that the second bridge has a curiously pitted appearance which you suspect has been caused by acid. The dilapidated bridge leads to another ledge that winds south-east alongside a very large lake, apparently the source of the underground river. The cavern is quite large; the lake's far shore is lost in shadow, and the echoes of water seem to indicate a very sizeable cave.

You consider using the feather token to create a magical swan boat, but you decide that the water here is too narrow. Remy, Badger and Ocardo lead the way. With two of you on the damaged bridge, it crumbles into the water and you are forced to jump to the other side. You use ropes to cross the fallen bridge and make your way around the edge of the lake towards some stepping stones. A short distance offshore sits a small isle thirty or forty feet across. Stalagmites thrust up at the ceiling above, and the dark waters lap quietly at its shores. Several spots on its surface glimmer even in the gloom, suggesting the promise of treasure to be had. But suddenly the ugly face of a black dragon rises from the water and breathes its acid breath over you.

Dioica, Bobolink, and Poon Tang are overcome by the acid. After its surprise attack, the dragon then dives beneath the surface and a swarm of stinging insects attacks you. You decide to flee back to the ladder, carrying the fallen with you. Ocardo covers your escape with his Darkness spell. And Remy and Badger fill the gap in the broken bridge by using the feather token to create a magical boat. You stabilise the unconscious while Claude heals them. Once he is revived, Bobolink finds himself finally free of the succubus' charm. He makes himself invisible and warns the rest of you about the succubus as you climb back up to the forge.

With Bobolink still invisible, you confront Idalla. She feigns concern for Bobolink but soon discovers that her game is up. Instead, she charms Remy and bids that he defend her as the rest of you attack. You damage her, but she fades into the ethereal plane where you are unable to reach her. Yet she still maintains her control over Remy. After several harsh slaps you manage to manage to snap him out of it. You track back to Idalla's room and find a secret compartment in one wall of the adjacent bedchamber. It contains 110 gold pieces, a cat's eye gem, an extensive collection of dwarven lore, and spell scrolls of alarm, disguise self, enlarge/reduce, and shield.

Remy appraises the gem as worth about 70 gold pieces and reads through the dwarven lore. It tells the history and fall of Khundrukar from the perspective of Arundil the dwarf mage. During the final assault of the orcs, Arundil used his magic to escape the slaughter. He returned to find all his kinfolk dead. Driven insane with grief, he tried to repair some of the complex's defences, animating dead warriors and various objects to kill any intruders that returned. In his madness, he even summoned a fiend. You guess the fiend to be Idalla and Arundil to be the ghostly dwarf you encountered in the halls.

You then discuss your next move. Bobolink recommends letting the dragon lie, returning to Blasingdell, and warning them against providing Idalla with any more victims. However, Badger uses his spirit seeker abilities to speak with the nearby animals. From this he determines that there must be a route from the dragon's lair to the outside, through which the dragon can hunt for food. Heading back out onto the mountainside you eventually find a dark mere. The fish here inform Badger of a hidden drainage channel deep underwater connecting to the dragon's lair. You decide to stake-out the entrance to the lair until the dragon next goes hunting and then sneak in to steal her treasure.

It takes a few days but your plan succeeds without detection and you fill your sacks with gold, silver, and other valuables. You then set off on a forced march back to Blasingdell working as best you can to hide your trail. A day into your journey, you see the black dragon furiously circling the stone tooth looking for the thieves that stole her treasure, but fortunately, she doesn't detect you. You stay over in Blasingdell only long enough to appraise your loot, trade some items, and stock up on supplies. In the dragon's hoard you found:

- 1,430 gold pieces
- 6,200 silver pieces
- a wand of magic missiles
- a +2 great-axe bearing Durgeddin's smith-mark
- a +1 shield
- a potion of healing
- a potion of flying
- two garnets worth 20 gold pieces each
- a black pearl worth 50 gold pieces

Baron Althon agrees to buy the hammer from you for 750 gold pieces and trade the +2 great-axe for a +1 spear and a +1 ring of protection. Before you leave Blasingdell, you warn the town about the dragon and the succubus at The Stone Tooth. Then you quickly head south towards Neverwinter.
