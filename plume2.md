# White Plume Mountain: Part 2

Ocardo casts _detect magic_ on the room and discovers that all of the finery is an illusion. Claude heals the wounded members of the party before you head back to the corridor heading north.

The door here is made of thick metal. The edges are flanged and overlap the door jamb on the north side. Remy listens at the door and hears the sound of bubbling water. He checks for traps, but finds none. Ocardo detects abjuration magic ahead. Claude casts light on a shield.

You open the door revealing another identical door ten feet further north. Badger spikes the door open and you open the next. Beyond is a third identical door. As you move further north it is getting warmer and the bubbling is getting louder.

Beyond the third door is a tunnel leading north for fifty feet and then opening into a large domed area. The tunnel is semi-circular and boiling water surrounds you. You are separated from the water by a magical field of force. At the far end of the domed chamber is a huge crab and a large chest. Claude suspects that the protective field could collapse if it is damaged by any slashing or piercing weapons or violent spells. He suggests un-spiking the door. Badger goes back to remove the spikes.

Remy suggests using the _dust of disappearance_ to sneak in and grab the treasure, but Ocardo thinks he can get in and out with his teleportation magic. He is able to _misty step_ himself behind the crab but as he grabs the chest, the crab catches him and begins to crush him in his giant claws. Ocardo uses _dimension door_ to teleport himself and the treasure chest back to the doorway. The crab starts to give chase.

Bobolink turns himself invisible. Claude hits the creature with a _guiding bolt_. Badger uses the _wand of magic missiles_. And Remy makes a sneak attack with his bow. Unfortunately, Remy's arrow goes wide and punctures the bubble behind the crab.

You get yourselves out of the bubble chamber and close the metal doors behind you. You can hear the crab bashing itself against the doors as Remy checks the chest for traps. Inside the chest you find:

- a sentient magic trident that calls itself Wave
- 1,000 gold pieces
- 20 gems
- some magic goggles
- a magic stone

You decide to deal with the crab before it can destroy the doors. Badger enters a rage and forces the crab back. Ocardo blasts it with an _eldritch blast_, Bobolink fires a _magic missile_, Remy hits it with an arrow, and Poon Tang skewers the creature with her knives. You defeat the huge crab just before the tear in the bubble rips open and a wave of boiling water comes toward you. Fortunately, the doors hold and you find a defensible area to take a short rest.

Wave attempts to get one of the party to convert to follow the Melora, the goddess of the sea. Nobody wants to take it up on its offer. Claude identifies the goggles as _goggles of the night_, and the stone as a _stone of good luck_. Remy takes the stone, and Claude takes the goggles. When you've rested and patched yourselves up, you go back to the fork at take the north east passage.

The water has recently drained from this passage due to you opening the drain valve earlier. The passage runs straight ahead but there is a patch of green slime on the floor ahead of you. Badger attempts to burn the slime but it is too wet. Claude blasts it with his _sacred flame_. After seventy feet, the passage turns east and then branch off to the north and south. You decide to take the south passage first. The passage ends in a swollen wooden door.

Remy checks for traps on the door but finds none. Badger tries to force the door open but it is stuck. Bobolink casts his _knock_ spell on it to open it. Bobolink, Remy, and Ocardo enter the room. As soon as they do so, the door slams shut behind them.

Inside the room, nine silvered glass globes about 2 feet in diameter, hang from the ceiling by wires. Ocardo detects magic in all of them. Bobolink and Remy attempt to break open one of the spheres. Inside they find a key and a ring.

Bobolink takes the ring and it speaks telepathically. "Stop before you put me on. I confer the following powers upon my wearer: _invisibility_, _haste_, immunity to charms, _fly_ once per day, _detect magic_, and one _wish_. I also provide the benefits of protection and spell turning. The only drawback is that once a year I permanently eat a small part of your life. I must be worn before I can leave this room; merely carrying me away is not possible. If ever I am removed from my wearer's finger, however, all my powers are lost. So you must decide right now who will wear me forever.‚Äù Bobolink immediately puts on the ring and uses the key to leave the room. It seems you chose the correct globe by chance.

However, before leaving the room, Ocardo blasts another of the globes. This one contains 9 gems and another key. You decide to collect the remaining treasures. The next globe you destroy releases an ooze.

Poon Tang attacks the ooze with an arrow. The arrow fizzes and burns away. Claude, Badger, and Ocardo hit it with magic attacks and destroy it. There is some jewellery and another key.

The next globe releases three shadows. Claude uses his _turn undead_ ability to destroy the creatures. The globe also releases 300 lead pieces and another key.

The next two globes contain two more keys and spell scrolls of _hold person_ which Claude takes and _fear_ which Bobolink takes. The next releases an air elemental.

You attack the furious whirlwind with magic attacks but little seems to effect it. It lifts and throws Ocardo into the room. Bobolink again turns himself invisible. Eventually with a combination of magical attacks you are finally able to stop the air elemental. The globe also contained some jewellery and a key.

The final globe contains 11 more gems and a final key. No key other than the first key you obtained fit the lock on the door. You check the rest of the room carefully for secret doors but you find nothing more here.

You try the passage north. This again ends in a swollen and iron bound wooden door. Remy again checks carefully for traps and finds nothing. Bobolink opens the door with another _knock_ spell.

Five flesh golems are clustered against the north wall. Each has a number on its chest: 5, 7, 9, 11, and 13. Number 5 says, "One of us does not belong with the others. If you can pick it out, it will serve you, and the others will allow you passage. If you pick the wrong one, we will kill you. You have sixty seconds."

Remy needs but one. He immediately answers "nine" as it is the only non-prime number. (He obviously did a module on number theory.) True to its word, Nine offers to serve you. You leave the room through the door in the north wall. A passage leads north, up some steps, and then east.

You come to a sturdy metal turnstile. The turnstile only rotates clockwise and allows you to travel east but will not allow you back. Badger and Nine both attempt to force the mechanism but it is too strong. You follow the passage east and then south until you reach a small door.

The door opens onto a stone platform in a large natural cave. Opposite the entrance in the distance is another stone platform. Between them, a series of wooden disks is suspended from the ceiling by massive steel chains. The cave floor seems to be covered by a pool of boiling mud.

![a series of wooden disks suspended by chains](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/128/totyp-04-05.png "Geysers and Chains")

You leave Nine at the entrance to the cave. Ocardo teleports across the gap taking Claude with him. Bobolink attempts to use his magic ring to fly across. But it appears to be inert. You get the sense that someone is playing tricks on you. Bobolink tosses the ring into the pool of boiling mud beneath. A geyser erupts reaching nearly to the roof of the cave.

Remy uses his whistle and carries Bobolink across. Badger and Poon Tang jump recklessly across from disk to disk and narrowly avoid falling into the boiling mud below or being hit by a geyser.

A passage leads south ending at a door, similar to the other door except riddled with tiny holes. You open the door and beyond is utter magical darkness. Only Ocardo's _devil's sight_ can penetrate it. Inside, rising from its coffin is a vampire. He puts his _hexblade's curse_ on the creature.

The vampire attempts to charm Ocardo, but this time he resists. He moves in. But this vampire is not hindered by the magical darkness, having magical _truesight_ of his own. He moves in and out of his room in the blink of an eye. Bobolink turns himself invisible but the vampire can still see him. He strikes Bobolink and then in a flash he is back to Ocardo. Claude dispels the _darkness_ so the rest of you can see and you throw everything you've got at the vampire.

The vampire calls on the _children of the night_. Swarms of rats answer his call. But its too late. Poon Tang pierces the vampire with an arrow
and turns him to a mist. And Bobolink casts a _chromatic orb_ to disperse the mist and the rats.

You search the coffin for traps and find that the space beneath it contains:

- a sentient warhammer calling itself Whelm
- 10,000 silver pieces
- 9,000 gold pieces
- a potion
- spell scrolls of _conjure minor elementals_, _dispel_, and _magic mouth_

![an ornate warhammer, bags of coins, scrolls, and a potion](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/129/totyp-04-06.png "The vampire's treasure")

The warhammer introduces itself as Whelm. It can only be attuned to by a dwarf. But it is at least happy to be finally free of the vampire. It appears disdainful of Wave although happy to be re-united.

Badger rips up the vampire's coffin and throws it into the boiling mud. You take long rest here. During your rest, Claude identifies the potion as a _potion of mind reading_.

When you are fully rested, you backtrack to the three-way fork. Collecting Nine and destroying the turnstile on your return. This time you take the north west passage.

Halfway along the passage you find a water filled pit. You explore the pit but don't find anything other than water in it. Had you not drained the passages earlier you may not have detected the pit until you had fallen in. In seems to be a simple hazard to trick the unwary.

Beyond the pit, the passage turns north. A series of copper-coloured metal plates lines the walls of the path before you. You search for traps here but find nothing obvious. You cautiously attempt to move north but find that anything metal you carry with you heats continuously as you travel north.

Badger soaks a bag in the water from the pit and puts all of his and Claude's weapons and metal items into it. They then try to pass north. They are able to make it through although the bag catches fire and the metal is red hot by the time they reach the other end.

At the other end, the passage opens into an empty chamber. As Badger and Claude are waiting for the weapons and armour to cool, a secret door opens and eight ghouls emerge. Each ghoul is wearing an amulet. Badger attacks the ghouls bare handed. Claude uses _sacred flame_. Poon Tang transforms into a wolf and runs through to join the fight. Bobolink drops his weapons and runs through. Ocardo teleports to the far side taking Remy with him. Nine lumbers through.

The ghouls all miss their targets. Bobolink casts mirror image on Badger. Badger takes out one of the ghouls in hand to hand combat. The golem rips two more into pieces. Claude destroys one with a _sacred flame_. Remy peppers the ghouls with arrows while Ocardo uses a _shatter_ spell on them. Finally, Bobolink sets the remaining ghouls on fire with his _burning hands_.
