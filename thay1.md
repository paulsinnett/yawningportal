# Dead in Thay: Part 1

![two red wizards and a scholar in a shadowy hall](https://media-waterdeep.cursecdn.com/attachments/2/154/totyp-05-book.jpg "Dead in Thay")

You journey to Daggerford. There you find Bloodgate Keep in ruins. It does not take you long to find the teleportation circle as described in the rumours and before you can figure out how it operates, you find yourselves transported to a shadowy hall with glowing teleportation circles etched into the floor. An image of a female Red Wizard suddenly appears before you and speaks.

"I am Syranna," she says. "It was I who brought you here. Welcome to Thay."

"Many Red Wizards chafe under the rule of Szass Tam. Once, Thay was a land of learning and power. Now, death scours Thay while the lich lord ignores all concerns other than his quest to become a god. If his mad plans are left to run their course, none will be left alive here to worship him."

"This is a magic gatehouse, from which I can send you to the Doomvault -- the heart of the lich lord's domain deep beneath the Thaymount. The Doomvault is a secret laboratory and containment structure, beneath which lies a hidden storehouse where the phylacteries of Szass Tam's elite liches are held. There, the lich lord's power can be broken ... with your aid."

"I offer you an opportunity to take the fight to the lich lord. I offer you the chance to help me see to it that Szass Tam's power is broken. The Phylactery Vault is where you can make that happen."

"What say you?"

"For centuries, the Doomvault was a legend. Kazit Gul, a Red Wizard who spent his life studying the deadliest dungeons on many worlds, planned it. As a living human and a lich, Gul fashioned the vast complex based on his research. The purpose of the dungeon was to lure explorers to their deaths and harvest their souls to fuel Gul's phylactery."

"As Thay became more hostile to outsiders, fewer people sought the Doomvault. Eventually, unable to fuel his phylactery, Gul became a demilich. Szass Tam discovered the Doomvault and saw the opportunity to rebuild and repurpose it."

"The Doomvault is a vast, active complex of laboratories and menageries dedicated to creating the monstrous armies with which the Red Wizards plan to conquer first the North, then all of Faerûn. The dungeon is divided into sectors dedicated to the creation and control of specific types of monsters."

"Each sector is subdivided into protected zones for security, defending against attack from outside and betrayal from within, as well as the escape of confined creatures. Magical white gates block corridors, preventing physical access between zones. Magical black gates are teleportation circles that connect different parts of the dungeon."

She describes each gate type's appearance so you will know the gates by sight.

"Magic crystals called glyph keys, when attuned to a zone, allow access to that zone's gates."

Syranna describes the use of glyph keys, including how to transfer attunements. She also describes contact stones and how the characters can use them to contact her directly. Through contact stones, you can also gain glyph key attunements for the zone in which the contact stone is situated. Syranna initially provides the party with one glyph key.

"You have three goals: (1) Destroy the Red Wizards' monstrous creations and experiments to end the threat to Faerûn. (2) Gain access to the Phylactery Vault deep beneath the dungeon. (3) Destroy the phylacteries within the vault. Tarul Var's quarters lie in the Doomvault. Although the lich was defeated, he might have already rematerialized thanks to the power of his phylactery. Protected by his dread warriors, he is a deadly threat."

Syranna provides information on dread warriors and how Tarul Var uses them. Szass Tam controls entry to the Phylactery Vault. Syranna knows the vault connects to the greater Doomvault, but hasn't discovered how to access it. The rebels will use their power to stop magical communications to the outside and contain any enemies who escape from the Doomvault. They'll make sure that no one outside the dungeon knows of or reacts to what's happening until you succeed.

"Thayans have taken two adventurers, Shalendra Floshin and Kelson Darktreader, prisoner. They are likely dead or within the Doomvault."

Syranna teleports a map and a glyph key to you. She will attune it to whichever zone you choose as an entry point.

You choose the Abyssal Prisons and Syranna teleports you to the entry point.

Scorched and shattered plaster shows faint signs of frescoes that once covered the walls here. A half-dozen ruined chandeliers hang from the cracked ceiling. In the northeast corner is the black gate through which you emerge. In the chamber is a female human vampire spawn along with a wight and four zombies. There is an exit in the west leading down some steps into a large columned temple. You can hear sounds of fighting coming from the west.

Remy introduces himself to the vampire spawn who calls herself Eldrath. She wants to know where you are taking your prisoners. Remy manages to convince her that you are taking your human and dwarf prisoners, Chas and Dave, for questioning. She watches you closely as you leave the room.

In what might once have been a columned temple you can see rotting tapestries showing foul creatures tormenting humanoids in scenes of slaughter and sacrifice. At the center of this vast space, the stone floor has been hewn to create a pit. This pit is covered with the gory remains of past bloodshed. It is from here that you can hear the sound of combat. Watching intently at the other side of the pit is a pale human vampire in lavish clothes.

Remy and Badger approach the pit. Below you, you can see a bird demon fighting nine human prisoners and one gold elf knight. They jump down and attack the demon. Remy attacks with his rapier but is unable to damage the demon. Badger flies into a rage and make many wounding attacks. The bird demon lets out a horrifying screech which stuns most of its attackers. But Ocardo steps in and Blackrazor devours its soul while Remy uses his eagle whistle to fly himself and the elf knight out of the pit.

The elf knight introduces herself as Shalendra Floshin. She says that she had been captured during the assault on the Bloodgate and that she had managed to survive and help the other prisoners stay alive. She wishes to return to the gatehouse as soon as possible to recuperate. And she gives you the following piece of knowledge
> In the Abyssal Prisons, the maze of undoing has no easy exit, but fiends that can climb are said to have somehow escaped the magic there.

Meanwhile, the vampire introduces himself as Issem. He is cursed to serve the Thayans and cannot leave the Doomvault. But he hates the Red Wizards and is willing to provide some lore of his own; in exchange for a taste of fresh blood. Ocardo agrees to the bargain and Remy offers to comfort him in his ordeal in traditional elf fashion[^1] as Issem drains some of his blood. In exchange, he gives you the following piece of lore.
> In the Predator Pools, the hag seeks allies in her plot against the naga.

Remy and Badger decide to scout ahead to the south and the predator pools. Here you encounter your first white gate. A ten-foot-diameter circle of runes and clear quartz fragments is set into the floor. Within the circle, a luminous white mist shimmers, obscuring what lies beyond. You use your key to open the gate and pass through into the passage beyond.

The passage opens into a large circular room containing a large circular pool. There is a black gate at the far side of the pool. Dave senses danger in the pool. A monstrous kraken lies at the bottom and attacks as you approach. Dave attempts to control the creature with Wave's domination magic but he is unable to stop it. A tentacle grabs Remy and begins to crush him. Badger hacks at the tentacles and Ocardo puts his curse upon it. Fortunately, Wave manages to charm the creature and gets it to put Remy down.

You get Shalendra to lead the human prisoners towards to the black gate. A ten-foot-diameter circle of runes and black onyx fragments is set into the floor. It exudes wisps of shadowy energy that look like curling black smoke. You use the glyph key to deactivate the gate and create a portal back to the gatehouse. Shalendra leads the nine human prisoners out of the Doomvault and you quickly return to the arena before Wave loses control of the kraken.

You rest here for a moment, while Chas heals Remy. Then you continue along the passage to the northeast. Here Remy spots and disarms some pit traps and you pass another white gate. Beyond, you enter a long hall lined with scorched wood-panelled walls. Cracks in the panels reveal bare stone. Three mystic circles have been scribed in the floor, each edged with rough runes. There is a door in the middle of the east wall.

As you enter the room, one of the circles glows white and lightning discharges through the room. Fortunately you are able to avoid taking too much damage as Remy quickly unlocks the door. Beyond lies an opulent chamber. Inside, the sweet scent of incense hangs in the hot air. The walls are covered with silk tapestries in green and yellow, and the floors are spread with cushions. To the south, two sets of sliding double wooden doors are set in the walls.

In this chamber are four Thayan Warriors and a Thayan princess named Pencheska. Pencheska tells you that she is being held prisoner by Tarul Var. You investigate the room. The doors open into Pencheska's wardrobes containing fine clothes and jewellery. Whelm tells Chas that there are two secret doors in this room: one in the south wall and one in the east. You decide to try the secret passage south.

It leads into an enormous hall, set with rows of pillars carved in the shapes of elemental and demonic creatures. A great rift has been torn in the center of the stone floor. Through it, a stream of chaotic energy blasts upward, flowing into a similar rift in the vaulted ceiling forty feet above. Tendrils split off from the pulsing column of energy, lashing out to strike the nearest pillars.

In the southwest corner is another black gate. Anyone entering this room is hit with chaotic elemental energies flowing from the rift. Pencheska is unwilling to risk crossing this hall so you decide to try the secret door in the east wall of her chamber instead.

A blast of heat escapes as the door opens. A howling creature of flame roils at the center of a soot-streaked stone chamber whose walls are lined with glowing runes. Pencheska decides to remain in her chamber while you figure out what to do next.

Claude suspects that the elemental creature trapped here is not hostile, just unable to escape. He casts _banishment_ to return it to its own plane. With the elemental creature gone, the room cools and you are able to cross without suffering any burns. Beyond the doors at the eastern end of the chamber you find a trapped forking passage leading east and south blocked by a white gate. You take the south passage, carefully avoiding the pit traps.

This area might once have been a great banquet hall, but its furnishings now lie in rotting piles along the walls. Between rows of pillars, six great magic circles glow brightly, illuminating the whole chamber. Two of the circles are empty, the other four contain quasits, manes, a bird demon, and a fire demon. All demons except for the manes ask to be released, promising to attack the Thayan forces if they are freed. Patrolling the room are a dread warrior, two wights, and six zombies.

Claude turns the wights while Badger kills the dread warrior. Remy shoots one of the wights with his magic bow. The bow targets the creature with supernatural accuracy. A zombie strikes Badger and Remy attempts to shoot it, but the bow pulls his shot back towards the wight. Poon Tang kills one of the zombies while Badger pursues the remaining wight out of the chamber through the doors to the south. The wight steps nimbly over a pit trap but, in his haste, Badger triggers the mechanism and falls in onto a bed of stone spikes. Remy shoots the remaining wight before it can escape.

You pull Badger back out of the trap and Claude heals him and then casts _identify_ on Remy's bow. He determines that it is cursed by a god and will only reliably target wights.
